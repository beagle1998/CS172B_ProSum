Salt? Alcohol? Fat?  I do not mean in any way to be a food fear monger. I merely point out that first glance, acid seems more menacing than any of those.  For kitchen magic, acid rules mine.  A splash of lime, coffee in my red-eye gravy, all those wonderful vinegars are lining my shelf.<br /><br />Now the resurgence of an ancient and feisty acid, verjuice.  It has largely been neglected outside of wine country.  Most of mine comes from odd places in Bordeaux.  But you can get this fine find from Fallot, a most reliable maker from Burgundy.  You may know their fine mustards.  This is one verjuice which you may confidently measure others against.  Why?<br /><br />Verjuice had not had modern marketing to spread its unique quality and flavor.  Sour grapes, you say? Exactly.  What do you do when the weather is so crumby that the grapes are not sweet enough for wine?  A good excuse to press verjuice.<br /><br />Now for the bad news.  Verjuice is in resurgence.  As with all things rediscovered, many are busy ""helping"" its image with a facelift.  Culinary botox.  From California to Australia, everybody is getting into the act; thin or flabby faux verjuice is hitting the shelves.  All cute and flouncy, it has not the backbone and courage to do the heavy lifting in the kitchen.  You might as well pour lemonade over your grilled salmon.<br /><br />But here is the acidic glory.  Taste it alone.  Now you can compare anything you might run across.  Some vineyards make the veritable verjuice.  Next, try poaching gently some fresh and really ripe fruit.  It loves to be swirled into your beurre blanc.  Whip some into your best cream.  Deglaze the roasting pan for some old time gravy.  Nutmeg and a nice five pepper blend (don't forget the allspice) are all you need for your steamed vegetables.  ""What did you do?""  And you can tell the truth."

It has a wonderfully well balanced and pleasing flavor.  The additional herbs give it an added complexity not found in most chais and even a hint of sweetness.

I've even used one tea bag with a bunch of regular tea bags to make some iced tea that's quite nice in the summer.

One of the first things I noticed after baking with this flour is that I no longer ""bloated"" or had intestinal distress after eating the foods made with this flour. Soooo nice! My doctor recommended this flour to me, and I'm glad I followed his recommendation. I did an experiment to make sure that it wasn't a coincidence that after eating the Hodgson Mill Organic Naturally white flour I didn't bloat, become puffy, etc. I made some cookies and muffins using the Hodgson Mill flour, and I made the same cookie and muffin recipe with typical white flour (all the rest of the (organic) ingredients were identical). I had intestinal distress, bloated, and had facial and hand puffiness after eating the desserts with the typical flour. When the bloating subsided, I waited an additional 6-8 hours, and I ate the desserts made with the Hodgson Mill flour....nothing happened - no bloating, no puffiness, and I felt great. The Hodgson Mill flour makes you feel good after eating it. I'm delighted to find a flour that doesn't have an adverse reaction on me. ALSO! The flour bakes and cooks great. The texture is wonderful - actually better than typical flour. My cookies, breads, muffins, pie crust, brownies, gravy, etc come out wonderful with this flour. I receive a lot of compliments on my desserts when using Hodgson Mill organic flour. Sometimes people find it hard to believe when I tell them that the flour is organic and naturally white.

Most importantly, this is Vermont maple syrup, which is required by Vermont law to be produced with a higher level of purity and less water than maple syrup from elsewhere in the US (e.g., New York) or Canada.  Vermont maple syrup is as good as maple syrup gets, and this brand is good Vermont maple syrup.  When comparing this product against other syrups from New York or Canada, keep in mind that you're getting more syrup and less water, since Vermont maple farmers boil it down more to give you a more concentrated flavor.<br /><br />It's worth pointing out that Grade A dark amber is probably your best bet for pancakes, waffles and the like, having more flavor than the lighter Grade A syrups (light amber, fancy), and being a cleaner taste than grade B syrup.  The difference in grades and colors is based on which part of the short maple harvesting season the syrup is gathered in: Grade A dark amber comes in the heart of the season, later than the early-season lighter syrups, and before the trees are really warming up, when the baking-quality Grade B is harvested."

Many other cat foods have rice or chicken by-products as the first ingredient. This food is specially formulated for the older, indoor cat. The other good thing about this food is that it is low in protein (27%), which is important for older cats because of decreased renal function; Purina One mature formualtion has too much protein (37%). My cat really likes the taste and he had no problem switching to this food from Purina One. This is a high-quality cat food and although it is a bit more expensive than other brands, my cat is well worth it!!"

My eldest has since gone to the Rainbow Bridge to wait for me, but he enjoyed this food until the end. I tried to switch my other cat to a different, less expensive brand that also has lower protein and natural ingredients, but he eats only enough to not be hungry; he is not enjoying his food.

I bought olive oil at my local grocery store but I didn't really know anything about it.  In time I learned about cold-pressed olive oil being preferred.  Next i learned a little more about the deeper concepts of olive oil.  I sampled various relatively expensive domestic brands, the kinds available at my local Harris Teeter.  But my experiences weren't very fruitful.  I simply wasn't moved.  Until I decided to give in to a wild hare and order a foreign bottle of olive oil.  And WOW!  What a difference!! Such a fruitful nose and a beautiful color.  I never knew it could be like this.  I simply didn't have a clue that this could exist.  But what I ordered was fairly expensive.  At least compared to what I could get locally.  THIS PARTICULAR olive oil was my second foree into non-domestic samples.  And not only is it better than the first REAL olive oil I tried, it's cheaper.  If you choose this olive oil you're going to pay about 30% more than what you can get locally.  With shipping costs and all.  (Minus sales tax, yay!)  But this olive oil is very high quality.  And although it costs a tad bit more that what you can buy locally, the lift in quality makes it worth it ten times over.<br /><br />I just ordered my second bottle and I see this as being something I do every 3 or 4 months."

Its like an energy drink without all the sugar which means you don't come down and fall on your face later in the day! This is a different kind of energy boost, one that makes you more alert and on the ball and it does not end abruptly finding yourself feeling lower than before you had the drink as energy drinks do.

Butterscotch is love for me. It's another Dad memory, he loves it and it makes me think of him...or maybe I'm just homesick this week. Butterscotch pudding is the only pudding I'll touch and if an ice cream shop offers butterscotch topping, I'll risk the dairy allergy to get a cone covered in the stuff. Liquid gold, it is. And seeing the success of Red leaf Tea's Caramel and French Vanilla flavors, I have complete confidence in this blend being amazing. I think this definitely calls for a hot tea latte, despite it being stupidly hot outside. Am I in Toronto or back in Tennessee? These hot days are killing me...I should be able to handle them better!<br /><br />No, I went for a cold matcha instead, it's too hot out there to bother with hot drinks, though this one was made to be enjoyed hot.

I want to sip on this all day, but I need to save some for when it's cool enough to be able to handle a hot drink. It does taste like candy, but it's not overwhemingly sweet. It's just tasty.  I'm not wowed by it like I am with some of their other blends, though. This one's good, but I need to try it a few more times before I decide if I'm going to keep it on my shelf or not.

I have no idea if I would like these bars as much if I were still able to eat 'regular' food.

While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The ""mouth feel"" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams ""Wheat-Free"", ""Gluten-Free"" and ""Non-Dairy"", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with ""chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.""<br /><br />The box also lists ""180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids"", ""9 Grams Whole Grains"" and ""0 Grams Trans Fats"", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that ""Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations."" Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name. Unless you especially like coconut, you may do better seeking gratification elsewhere. And if you dislike coconut, definitely steer clear."

I'm not really fond of agave and don't feel they really need it, since there is also some sugar in the chocolate chips. There is also a little too much salt for my taste but I still think this is a great quick snack for rare occasions.<br /><br /> I make my own cookies with apple sauce, using a variation of a recipe on the side of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDDS6Q"">Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli, 40-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> but I leave out the sugar and salt and I add some coconut.

I do know what it's like to be unable to digest food that you like (in my case, any sort of meat) and wheat is even more difficult to avoid, so I can sympathize.<br /><br />Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars are meant to provide a tasty, healthful snack for the gluten-intolerant. They're sweetened with agave and the ingredients are palatable to both celiac sufferers and those who just want a snack that's devoid of white sugar. These bars are guaranteed gluten-free, come individually wrapped, and are packed five to the box.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are actually pretty tasty--their lack of ingredients like stevia ensures that they have a pleasant sweetness that's gentle and tastes completely natural. And the other flavors are well-balanced as well--there are plenty of chocolate chips of good quality and the presence of coconut is a plus. But the fact of the matter is that Pamela's Products Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut Whenever Bars suffer from a fault that's pretty consistent in individually wrapped desserts of this kind: they're just too damp and lacking in crispness. Yes, I know that we all want chewy cookies nowadays and that cookie dough is held to be a gastronomic pinnacle to some. But I prefer my ""soft"" tempered by some external ""snap,"" so this isn't the ideal snack for me. It tastes nice but the texture, for me, falls short (your own mileage may vary).<br /><br />Regardless of my personal quirks, the fact that the food industry is accommodating those with food sensitivities and doing their best to do so in such a way as to use quality ingredients is fantastic.

I am very impressed with these grain bars as I am with most of Pamela's Products.  They are very tasty.  In the sample I received the bars were very balanced with chocolate and coconut flavors.  The grains are soft and chewy, speckled with seeds that give a faint crunch.  They are sweetened just enough.  I find them most welcome to my gluten-free life, as I've never had a gluten-free grain bar that was any good.<br /><br />I am not thrilled that they are sweetened with agave.  Based on reading I've done I just don't find that it's saving me much in the way of health or natural foods.  It's also still packs a decent whop on the glycemic index, if you have to be careful about blood sugar.  As well, these bars had almonds and potential traces of dairy.  So if you need to steer 100% clear of such these may not work for you.  They are not protein bars, so they wouldn't be a good meal replacement, or even a healthy snack if you are monitoring carbs.  They are, however, great for when you just need something a little sweet.<br /><br />If they are priced in the store as they are on Amazon, they are the same as and/or less than other traditional grain bars and gluten-free snacks.  I'd also like to point out that the item description says there are 6 in a box.  There are 5, as the box clearly states.

I want to taste my food and know it's healthy, than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely, so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the coconut, but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of, with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.<br /><br />I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting, small cookie."

I love coconut, but I didn't even notice it.  I'm sure someone who hates coconut would definitely notice, but the overall taste was quite sweet, so it just mixed in with everything else.

Seeing how chocolate chips and coconut are a combo I can't resist, I had to give these a try. Wow was I surprised. These are actually really tasty. The big test was offering the kids a taste of this new cookie. They loved it and immediately ask for their own to chow on. I caught my 4 year old sneaking one out of the package thinking she was stealing dessert. The ingredients on the side are all things I can pronounce and I didn't notice a single thing I would be afraid to feed my family. Bonus points for containing some organic ingredients AND being packaged in 100% Recycled Paperboard AND printed with Soy Ink. I love ""greened"" products! I also love that it contains Omega 3 Fatty Acids. I've tried incorporating more Omega 3's into our diet and it has been surprisingly difficult. These will make a great afterschool, pre-game, or on the go snack to toss in my purse. Only complaint is the bar was falling apart when I took it out of the wrapper. Not sure if that is a product flaw or if it happened during shipping. Either way this is a  product, and brand, I look forward to trying more. Yay for healthy snacks!"

The card was hand printed with very poor handwriting, most of what I wanted on the card wasn't easily read and that was true for all three arrangements.  Nothing about the arrangements would even tell me which florist was responsible for fulfilling the order.  Another testament to a bad relationship with its florists.

We have started adding a few things like fresh blueberries, Watkins flavorings and other fruit to give them some variety without adding a lot of calories. Keeping the calories in check was a goal we had too when deciding on this mix.<br /><br />If you like waffles and looking for a good alternative to the normal mixes, this is it.

The pancake batter before mixed w/ water smells like fresh baked sugar cookies. Then I added water and poured it into my waffle maker/grill. Cooked up fine with no graininess or lumps. I didn't follow the directions of 1 cup water to 1 cup mix. I just added water and stirred until I  got my desired consistency. My waffles looked like any other waffle. I poured my syrup and it was to my surprise delicious. Very light flavor. Not bitter or too sweet. I expected a strong bitter taste when I saw wheat flour and a gritty or graininess b/c it's organic but it's a smooth texture like ihop pancakes or regular pancakes. The vanilla and the honey in the mix give a nice mild taste to it without making the pancakes too sweet. I think the buttermilk they use makes the over all product not taste like cooked grain mush as well. I would definitely buy this mix again. I got the 3 pack for $11 through amazon's subscribe and save. I've heard 1 box can run you anywhere from $6-8. I'm not a big breakfast person, but will look forward to these 4 breakfast. My friend is a southern and he makes chicken and waffles with this mix , but he uses tofu instead of chicken though since he's vegan.<br /><br />p.s - be careful using oils such as olive and coconut that over heat to easily when using waffle maker or even on the stove.

I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.

I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plant's well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.<br /><br />Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lou's Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.<br /><br />I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy."

I purchased this Desert Rose for my dad because he fell in love with the one in the photo and the description (~15 years old desert rose). The Amazon shipping weight says 21lbs, mine was UPS 3lbs. I was totally disappointed as I paid $95 with shipping just to get a desert rose that does not look like it's 15 years old. The caudex on the plant I got was only ~2-3"" wide and the one in the photo looks about ~6-7""+ wide.<br /><br />I contacted Lou immediately (I also have no idea why the seller's name is Sheryl when the actual seller is LouBonsai) and he is great at responding. He told me he would ship me a new plant and I kept emailing to make sure it's not just ANY desert rose, but SPECIFICALLY the one similar to the photo. However, their responses were brief and not descriptive about what they are sending (i.e. the response was ""BIGGER AS I WAS TOLD""). I felt as if my concerns were not answered. Lou said he was going to send me a new plant with a tracking number on 7/23 but I heard nothing. I had to email him on 7/25 to ask, they provided one and said I was able to track it the next day. It's 7/27 now and the UPS tracking number still says that a label has been created but package is not dropped off yet. I'm a very disappointed customer at this point.<br /><br />It would be nice for them to list the actual plant they are selling because it's definitely not the one I received.<br /><br />2 stars for responsiveness."

A friend of mine introduced me to this drink based on his own childhood remembrance in the Midwest.

And you certainly can't drink it like Diet Coke since it is an astonishing 200 calories a can. But baby boomers should have a stash when they feel like a walk down a sugar-infested memory lane.

My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i/o something dry and bland.<br /><br />You'll never fail at gravy-making with Bisto Favourite!"
15401,B000FAAY4M,A1VN7PA3TYI8RO,Indolent,2,2,5,1316390400,Aaaaahhh!! Bisto!! This really does make the best gravy.,"So, ideally we'd all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat we're cooking, but... sometimes you just don't get that much in the way of pan drippings, and yet you want LOTS of gravy. And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but these ""favourite"" granules are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak ""pot"" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!"

Unlike their duck, chicken, veal, lamb and seafood products, this one can be added to almost anything. Soups, stews, sauces, what have you. This will add depth to all of the other More Than Gourmet stocks and glaces.<br /><br />They start with a classic ""essence de champignon"" (which is a mushroom stock containing sherry, salt, garlic and spices) and then they reduce it to 1/20 of it's volume. Since it is bound with a starch (Tapioca) it will help to add some body to a sauce. It can be used minimally diluted and poured over carrots, fish (really just about anything that would taste good with mushrooms), or added to an existing sauce or dish.<br /><br />I often make my own mayonnaise using safflower oil, egg yolks, Dijon mustard, lemon juice and various seasonings. I usually serve it as an elegant topping for fish or vegetables (it's great on asparagus) but I always thought that it could be better. I now add just a teaspoon of the More than Gourmet Essence De Champignon Gold and I can't believe how much better it is!<br /><br />I am a lifelong carnivore but some members of my family are vegetarians. When I cook for them I substitute this for a veal, chicken or beef demi-glace. I even add it to vegetable stock to give it that extra dimension. Sometimes I buy it in the 16 oz. tub, other times I like the convenience of the small 1.5 oz cups.

Sprinkle the seasoning to your taste - I like lots of seasoning, remember you will lose some while grilling. Flip the steak and do the other side. Let it soak while lighting the grill. Just before grilling, lightly brush the steak with melted butter - be careful to not remove the seasoning! Make sure the grill is REALLY hot! Sear the outside and spray it again with a bit of bourbon. Flip the steak and do the other side. Flavor is similar to the Bourbon Street Steak at Applebees. My opinion is mine is a little better . . . It may take you 2-3 times to get it down pat but it is SO worth it!!!"

It was $20 and rather than returning it, I decided to try using it. It is the best steak I have had. I like sirloin better than ribeye because it's leaner. I would suggest following the recipe exactly. I use a Coleman stove out doors with a heavy steel French frying pan. Cast iron would work well too. It will smoke up your house unless you have an industrial hood. I never order steak anymore. It's always better at home.

I am so impressed with the convenience that I have with making these products in my Keurig brewer. In about 30 seconds, I have the drink of my choice to enjoy. I used to be frustrated with the length of time it takes to make sweet tea - brewing the tea bags and then having to wait for the brew to chill in my fridge take about half a day. And then you have to drink it in a timely manner so that the tea doesn't lose its freshness. But with these tea Kcups, I can have a fresh brewed sweet tea in 30 seconds made specifically for me or my guests and it is so fresh tasting and cool and refreshing. My friends who frequent coffee shops, have been impressed with the quality of the coffee and say that the brew is just as good if not better than local coffee shops because it is so fresh and made just one cup at a time.

I was so happy to find something like this for my 7 year old!  Unfortunately, the cupcakes were really - icky.  They tasted like corn muffins.  My son is gluten free due to sensitivity, not a disease.  Therefore he does not have to be 100% gluten free.  This makes our choices a bit wider when I am looking at ingredients for him.  The chocolate chip cookies were very good and I'd buy the mix again and make them.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla cupcake mix.  We found them heavy, and didn't really like the taste.  They were totally disappointing.  I can now go to Hannafords and buy pre made gluten free cupcakes that are actually yummy - they are also a bit heavy.  They don't taste like corn bread and that is the plus.  My suggestion if you order these is make them mini cupcakes and make or buy your own frosting.  For someone who is gluten free, they do taste better than lots of things you can buy and make.  For kids who aren't - they will notice a big difference and most likely not like or want them."

Needless to say, I wanted to make sure he got to eat a cupcake too, but I didn't want to buy a bunch of weird flours and get stuck with the excess.<br /><br />One box didn't make 12 cupcakes like the box said, although if you don't fill the cupcake cups up, i'm sure you could get 12 out of the mix.  I like to fill my cupcakes a little fuller though, for aesthetics, so I ended up using both boxes to make about 18 cupcakes.<br /><br />The flour mixture itself was very fluffy and well sifted, which always makes for a nice cake consistency.  I didn't use the box directions, and instead used the weight watchers reecipe using orange soda and egg whites instead of eggs and butter.  The vanilla flavor wasn't completed covered up by the soda, so I imagien in a vanilla preparation it would taste pretty good.  The only off-putting part was when the cupcakes came out of the oven, they smelled a bit liek corn muffins.  but by the time they were frosted and decoarted, I didn't notice the corn smell.<br /><br />For the frosting packet, I used the butter and milk as described, but added orange flavoring to go with the orange soda cupcakes.  I think the buttercream mix was basically just confectioner's sugar that was processed without gluten 9since I think alot of corn starch used in regular powdered sugar is processed with wheat).  It didn't make very much frosting though.  Both packets together wouldnt have covered 24 cupcakes, but since I only ended up with 18 it came out perfectly.<br /><br />I made the cupcakes the night before they'd be served,  and the next day they were a little gummy, but not really much worse for the wear.

It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan-certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick breakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.<br /><br />But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.<br /><br />First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie-for-dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)<br /><br />Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.<br /><br />These problems could be solved by just selling single-container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is a good product."

The key for me, who prefers thicker (not watery) oatmeal, is to put just enough water in it to cook, not to be liquidy.  This makes the flavors pop.  The apples are chewy and do not taste processed.  The cinnamon is so good, especially at the bottom of the cup.  This is definitely a great product.  I LOVE the fact that its got half the sugar and is actually healthy.

I have a soft spot for apple cinnamon instant oatmeals and have, in the past, eaten Quaker's and McCann's versions. This one is by far the best. The flavor is nice, the apples rather generous, and it's light on the sweetness (which allows you to ratchet up the sweetness to your taste, which I appreciate).<br /><br />The texture IS NOT creamy right off, and this is a thing with instant oatmeals in general. Once you add the boiling water, let it sit for 3-5 minutes. I find when I let it sit about, stirring it up now and then, it gets to a truly comforting and nice ""gloopy"" oatmeal texture. If you just add water and stir--it will be ""pebbly"" and dry. Not nice. So, remember to give it time to get to the right texture.<br /><br />The ingredients list is minimal (which I like), the taste is very nice and ""clean"", and I tend to sweeten it just  a bit more.

Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.

Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry.

And, given the price, and how inexpensive some good-quality meat is at the grocery store, if you truly want to mesmerize your dog, go with real meat. Its pretty funny that so many of us are paying $7-9 for little bags of dog treats when we could be buying real beef for about $4-5 a pound.<br /><br />However, most of us don't want slimy hands all day, so we use treats. I use these out when walking my dog, and carry them when we go out backpacking or on long day hikes. I like them because they are feather light, but just don't get them wet or they turn to mush.

I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time.

It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!"

Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag ""freshness guaranteed."" That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh.

It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed.

There is NOTHING else like it on store shelves!  No, I am not the maker of this product or associated with it in any way other than being a HAPPY CUSTOMER!

I suggest you go to J&D's website & buy the original BACONNAISE and not the lite variety.<br /><br />  I was hooked on FAST FOOD, especially McDonald's Big Macs!  I got a jar of original Baconnaise (looks darker than the lite jar that is pictured here)  after seeing it featured on Oprah.  It was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!<br /><br /> Although it's NOT a diet food, I have lost almost 10 pounds in only 3 weeks because I'd rather eat at home using my Baconnaise than grab something at the drive-thru!  I especially like a lean Roast Beef sandwich with Baconnaise.<br /><br />No fast food means no french fries or super sized Coke, so I think that's why I'm dropping the pounds!  Financially, we're saving a lot of CASH $$$ because I have DISCOVERED something that makes me SATISFIED with what I'm putting in my mouth.  Does that make sense?  Seriously, it costs us about $20 a fast food meal & we used to eat out several times a week.  We still do pizza every so often, but fast food has lost its allure!<br /><br />  I even went so far as to dab on some Baconnaise on a stalk of (ugh) broccoli yesterday & it was EAT-ABLE for once!

Even eating some veggies is NOW a possibility (almost an unbelievable statement from a junque food junkie!)<br /><br />  I took the time to write this because I could NOT believe the negative reviews and wanted to CLARIFY for all of those thinking about trying Baconnaise to purchase the ORIGINAL Baconnaise formula.

The price is great on Amazon too!

It is slightly stronger than coffee people coffee shop but has a richer and more flavorful taste.  Not bitter at all, but if you like lighter roasts then you probably will not like this.  I think it tastes best using the 7-8 ounce setting.  This reminds of when I dine out and they have such good coffee but either they don't know or won't tell you what kind it is.  Love it!"

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.  I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee.  We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least.  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely.  And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee.  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried).  I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods.  Almost.  All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out.  When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE"">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!"

My mother used standard household blends such as Folger's for many years.  When she received her Keuring machine she started to experiment with other brands and blends.  She occasionally drinks a flavored coffee but this has become her favorite.  I get her a couple of boxes a month and she loves it.  I have tried it and here is my take on this blend:<br /><br />The body (or ""mouth-feel"") is light to medium.  The acidity is medium-low so it won't have too much of a bite, especially of you use cream.  The flavor is surprisingly complex with some spice (maybe cardamom or anise and a little pepper) as well as a rich coffee finish.  This will not replace my favorite dark roasts but I will keep it on hand for those guests who find a ""Starbucks-type"" of coffee too strong or bitter.

I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger. I give this k-cup an A+!"

I tried all of them and found this particular blend to be the best to my liking although I do prefer a light blend.  It has a nice coffee aroma (like one you would smell at a good restaurant but can't produce at home) and surprised me by tasting as good as it smelled.  It is a medium blend and tastes relatively smooth without an excessively strong or acidic aftertaste.  Recommend to fellow Amazon customers that prefer a  medium blend coffee.  I recently found the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend available at my local Walmart and plan to write a review on it.

The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />Moreover, the crackers contain defatted wheat germ; this is very healthy for you.<br /><br />The extra large size of these crackers makes them particularly useful when you serve them with a dip to guests.

I only received one 3-pack.  Amazon kindly refunded half of my money, but note that I would not have purchased the product at the current offer of one 3-pack for the same price.<br /><br />Black sugar is reputed to be eaten in Japan as a candy.  This black sugar tastes very nice that way, a bit like the penuche that I made as a child that didn't get cooked long enough and was partially crystallized when it cooled.  Add molasses taste to that, and I think that is pretty close.<br /><br />This black sugar is not uniformally dark throughout.  When you break the brick, in cross-section it is only dark for about one quarter of the way in from the surface top and bottom, and the same absolute distance on the sides.  The inner one-half is the color of light brown sugar.  I don't know what to make of that.  I don't know if it is normal for black sugar to be light brown inside.  Presumably the darkness is from the molasses, but I don't know why the molasses would look like it had soaked in from the outside instead of being uniformally distributed in the sugar brick.  The dark brown raw sugar from Africa, that I also bought, is uniformally dark but not as dark as the outside of this black sugar brick.  I imagine that if I pulverized the inner and outer sections of this Okinawa black sugar together I might get the same color as the dark brown sugar from Africa.  I haven't tried the experiment because the black sugar brick is not easily pulverized, although it is not too hard to bite.<br /><br />In summary, the taste is quite nice but I'm not at all sure that it is novel enough for the price I paid, let alone twice that much.  However, it is a taste of food from a place that I have never been and never will go, so I gave it four stars."

The taste is quite unlike other sugar.. with a strong molasses taste. the blocks are often darker on the outside, however, the taste is unmistakable, and this is quite definitely Black Sugar.<br />I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur, and I prefer to drink my coffee with real japanese black sugar or ""Kuro Sato"".<br />When I last ordered this product, it qualified for Free Super Saver shipping, which made it a good deal.

But I kept trying them and began to like them (probably because I didn't want to feel I was throwing $30 down the toilet).  I can't quite give them 4 stars, because they're not THAT great.  But I sometimes have a hard time stopping myself from eating them once I start.<br /><br />It would really be cool if Emerald could duplicate the taste that Blue Diamond has accomplished for their Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds.

While most nuts have a shelf life of a few months, walnuts go rancid within just a few weeks of being exposed to air and average 65-75 degree temp.  So if you buy 6 canisters of these and eat an ounce a day to help your cholesterol levels, they'll last you about 7-8 weeks. Which is the longest you should expect them to stay fresh.  If you want them to last longer -- freeze them in the unopened containers for up to 4 months.  And I'm guessing that jars or bags of walnuts are just wasted if sent through USPS/military mail channels to soldiers in Asia.  It's too hot and too long a trip.<br /><br />2.  If this product -- or any other for that matter -- arrives stale, then why aren't you calling Amazon or the supplier to return them and get your money back!  This is one of the reasons I try to buy items from Amazon that say they are sold and shipped by Amazon --because Amazon stands behind what they sell and I've never had a problem with getting  a replacement if something arrives in unsatisfactory condition.  To all those reviewers whining about stale products -- grow a pair, pick up the phone, and stand up for yourselves.<br /><br />3.  Read the reviews, and if you don't want seasoned nuts, don't buy these.  Not only are they seasoned, they also have a little sugar.  Not enough to raise the calories beyond those of raw walnuts, but it is a different nut than a fresh cracked walnut.<br />IF YOU WANT RAW WALNUTS, BUY WALNUTS IN THE SHELL.<br /><br />I agree that for internet buying purposes, the manufacturer should INSIST all the contents  be listed on every site, and should rename the product: SEASONED DRY ROASTED WALNUTS.<br /><br />The bottom line is, they have an excellent mild seasoned flavor, and a very DRY dry-roasted texture."

My order was refused because according to Amazon ""they can't ship food"" overseas.  From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.  It doesn't bother me that the vender can't ship, or for that mater won't take the initiative to sell to US Service People overseas, it is they Lied about it."

And if you keep one in your pocket or purse or bag, make sure you swap it with the one on your counter that you use for the morning coffee. What happens is that the liquid dries up and begins to clog the opening. Not right away, but after several months of being opened. And once it's clogged up the single drop either gets smaller or larger. The issue is that you want one perfect drop! No more, no less. One drop is VERY powerful. If you get half a drop, don't try adding more. Open a packet of Splenda and add a tiny bit. You can easily get coffee so sweet you'll have to throw it out.<br /><br />There are a lot of reviews on this product criticizing it for drying up and problems such as I've just mentioned. Consequently, the smaller the bottle the better. The faster you go through it and open a new one the less problems you'll have.<br /><br />After a week or so of using EZ Sweetz you'll be hooked.<br /><br />I'm an Amazon faithful, but I have to share this with you: Amazon charges $4.81 shipping for a six pack.

16015,B0009YWMYE,AA0BGTQHWKSQY,Peekablue,3,3,5,1265760000,An excellent food,"I have been feeding Blue Buffalo foods to my Golden Retriever, who is almost 3 years old, since I brought him home as a 7 week old puppy. As a veterinary technician, I am aware of many common health problems in the breed, allergies being one of them. Knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies, I wanted a food that only used the best ingredients. I looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo, it turned out, was the only such brand that was readily available in my area.<br /><br />The breeder had been feeding Eukanuba Puppy food, so I started ""Bruce"" on a mixture of the Eukanuba Puppy and the Blue Buffalo Puppy. He would actually pick out the Eukanuba and only eat the B.B. kibbles (one of my coworkers reports that her Dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to B.B.). So, I ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight B.B. He would, sometimes, pick out those ""Lifesource Bits"" and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all.<br /><br />As he is now an adult, I have been feeding him a variety of the B.B. flavors. I started him with the B.B. Large Breed formula, then switched to the Fish and Sweet Potato, then the Lamb and so on. I am hoping that by rotating the formulas, I will be able to prevent or, at least, cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients. Since he quickly scarfs down any food I put down for him, I can't see that he has any preference to flavor. He loves them all.<br /><br />I can report that, to date, ""Bruce"" has been an extremely healthy dog. His coat is thick and shiny, his eyes are clear, and he is a very solid 95 Lbs. Everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is. I know a lot of that is genetics but I'm sure Blue Buffalo had a little something to do with it, as well."

When I learned that, I switched immediately to food that doesn't have any in it (and most well known, readily available brands do).<br /><br />Our dog is very sensitive, and while she seemed to be doing well with BB's Wilderness Chicken, her poo smelled to the high heavens.  I read that it's often due to their not digesting chicken well; I guess she doesn't.  So, I switched her to the Lamb/Brown Rice formula.  She likes it, and, happily for everyone in the neighborhood, can digest it MUCH better (if you go by the stink factor).<br /><br />The only way she'll really go for it with enthusiasm (or any dry food) is to add some hot water to moisten it and release some aroma.  Otherwise, she holds out 'til right before she goes to bed 'cause she's starving.<br /><br />So, if your dog doesn't seem to like it, try adding a little hot water.  Our dog trainer (20 years experience) insists it's NOT bad for their teeth to do that (which I was concerned about initially)."

Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.<br /><br />My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.<br /><br />If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this brand.  If your dog picks out the ""bits,"" you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different brand."

Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity.

Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />The package design is getting better. The endorsement by Professional Chefs (a 2011 Chef's Best Award) is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no MSG added, there's 30% less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have 0 grams of trans fat.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Earlier this year, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, posted ""Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles."" I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I distilled his tips down to these four bullet points:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins -- Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br /><br />* Vegetation -- Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions ""should wilt in a matter of seconds.""<br /><br />* Eggs -- Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br /><br />* Simple Simmered Meat -- Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />Instant noodles available at Amazon that our family eats and recommends:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA"">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP136A"">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Kimchi</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I"">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A"">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG"">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Noodles</a><br /><br />In many cases you can sign up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program for additional savings and convenience."

The highly spiced chicken flavoring (definitely not for wimps!) is quite tasty.  The extra-long, curly noodles are delicious.  There are no vegetable or chicken bits in the bowl--the ones shown on the package label are apparently garnishes added for the photo shoot.  The ingredients list reveals more beef flavorings than chicken flavorings.<br /><br />The food prep couldn't be easier: (1) pull back the cover, (2) open the seasonings packet and dump it in, (3) fill the bowl with room temperature water, (4) microwave for 3 minutes, and (5) let cool for at least one minute before eating.  One is wise to heed the instructions to wait a bit before eating--my microwaved noodles were still too hot to eat after three or four minutes.  The bowl can also be prepared by adding hot water and letting the mixture steep for three minutes.<br /><br />Unfortunately,  the 2-serving bowl--and who eats only half a bowl of noodles?--delivers a whopping 1780 mg of sodium, even though this particular product has 30% less sodium than the manufacturer's regular product.  The FDA recommended daily intake for sodium is about 2300 mg of sodium, so if you eat the whole bowl, you have consumed about 77% of your day's recommended sodium.  (The package label is reasonably honest, stating that 1 serving delivers 37% of your daily sodium.)<br /><br />Because my diet is generally a low-salt one (by choice, not for medical reasons), I could tell that some of the spicy flavor was coming from salt rather than from other seasonings.  However, the product did not make me immediately thirsty, as most high-salt commercial food products do.  For me, this product is worth only three stars (""it's okay""), because I can't eat it on a regular basis and still keep my salt intake down.  That's too bad, because a product like this is great to have on the pantry shelf to pull out for a quick meal."
16056,B0054TWQ2C,A3PZ4AXTY9J1DZ,Jason Ralsky,3,3,4,1315872000,A Spicy Meal Alternative... But Pricy...,"I actually purchased a pack of NongShim Spicy Chicken bowls (pk of 12) from a local warehouse in my area.  Ever since college I've been a fan of these ""cup of noodles"" style meals during late Autumn and Winter.  Makes for quick alternative meal that warms you up.  How does Nongshim's spicy chicken version stand up against other brands I've had?<br /><br />Pretty good actually!  Each bowl contains a fairly large amount of noodles, compared to the cup variety.  The noodles are your typical standard dried Ramen noodle.  I am not a big fan of microwaving these products so I make mine by boiling water.  Just put some water up to boil, open the package and add the ""flavor pouch"" or Soup Base, add boiling water to the fill line and wait 3 minutes.  Instant hot soup with noodles.  While the noodles are standard , the broth is really good.  It has a lot of flavor to it and a good spicy kick to it.  Put the two of them together and you get a very satisfying meal that will fill you up, and wake you up.<br /><br />Despite having a good spicy broth and making for a  filling meal... This product does have some CONS I am wary of.  For one the product contains almost 1800mg of sodium for a single bowl.  This is insane!  Most of these cup/bowl of noodles are overloaded with sodium to begin with, but it still needs to be pointed out.  The fat content is a bit high also, at 14g for an entire bowl.  Another problem I have is that most of the products I've tried usually come in a sturdy container for your product.  Nongshim's Spicy Chicken Bowls come in a flimsy plastic bowl.  It works fine but once prepared I would definitely suggest carrying with two hands, as it has a very cheap feel to the bowl.  The price per bowl is also a bit expensive.  At the warehouse I purchased this, I paid $9 for 12 bowls.  I could of paid $6.50 for 24 cup of noodle varieties.  Compared to the cup variety, you are paying a premium for these; And while the bowl produced better quality broth, I don't see it being worth the price increase. (12 bowls = 24 servings.. $9 for 24 servings.  the cups were $6.50 for 24 servings.. so basically $2.50 more for bowls vs cups)<br /><br />OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  Despite having a flimsy bowl, and incredibly high amount of sodium the product makes up for it in the overall quality of its taste and sheer volume of noodles.  You get a big meal here that will both fill you, and warm you up.  It has a really nice spicy kick to the broth that lingers without becoming annoying(see NOTE).  I've always enjoyed spicy foods so having a few of these laying around the house helps if I just want a quick meal.  I would not recommend eating these everyday, in fact maybe I tend to aim for one a week.  Products like this are not exactly the healthiest alternative meal for you, but if you need a quick emergency meal these are a good alternative.<br /><br />NOTE: The product contains chicken but I really wouldn't call it chicken.  You might find a few tiny little bits of re-hydrated chicken<br />NOTE: I do not use the entire flavor/soup base packet.  The amount of sodium it contains is ridiculous!  I use no more than 3/4 of the packet.  I tried using the entire packet once and it made the broth start to taste far too salty, as well as making the spice in the broth overpower rather than compliment.  Don't be afraid to use less of the packet..."

Scott,6,8,4,1311638400,"Tasty, but overpriced and unhealthy","I had my picky 15-year-old son to try this Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl, and he liked it a lot: ""The flavor is good.

The picture on the package is misleading; the chicken chunks aren't that big.  Overall, quite good.""

If you enjoyed their age-old flavor don't fill the bowl all the way to the top.<br /><br />The second difference is that these bowls no longer insulate, so please be careful after adding boiling water.  WARNING: they are hot.  It's a design flaw in order to make the bowls recyclable/microwavable.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that they can be microwaved now.  The lids are different as well.  They don't have the same lining as before, but create a nice seal if you simply place a spoon over them for the three minutes after adding boiling water.<br /><br />I have yet to microwave a batch--it seems useless if you have a stove, so just be aware of the new design next time you go to enjoy a bowl."

Some haughty foodies are prejudiced against them because they are ""cheap eats"", but, even<br />if I were a millionaire, I'd still eat instant noodles. Nong Shim is currently my favorite brand by far, and their<br />products are several steps above ordinary instant ramen. The Spicy Chicken Flavor Bowl Noodle reviewed here is of<br />the microwavable quick-lunch variety, though I generally stick to Nong Shim's stovetop line.<br /><br />One issue with these noodle bowls is that some broth inevitably ends up on the turntable while cooking; some<br />plastic wrap on top should solve that problem. These noodles are more like standard ramen, and have a chewy<br />consistency. The broth is flavorful and pretty spicy for most people, though it seemed relatively tame to<br />this old chile dog's taste buds. Small chunks of chicken and vegetables are scattered throughout, and, as is<br />usual for Nong Shim, some rather exotic ingredients are present as well. A disclaimer on the package mentions<br />""sand lance"", which is presumably some sea creature used in Korean cuisine...I'll readily admit to having no idea.<br />I ought to mention that, in true Asian tradition, the noodles here are long and slurpable. If you can't bring<br />youself to slurp, you're advised to break the noodles up before cooking.<br /><br />The Spicy Chicken Flavor Bowl Noodle gives you just enough for a satisfying quick lunch. Nong Shim's stovetop<br />noodle packs are a better deal- I'm nuts about Chapagetti and Shin Ramyun- but the Noodle Bowls would be more<br />suitable to take to work in lieu of brown-bagging or relying on vending machines. Try them if you're a noodle fan."

But it is for sale here: [...]<br /><br />Just had a bowl of these for lunch. I'm not a huge eater, and found the volume of this to be okay. I'm glad I brought some corn chips to supplement (I know, not the best combo). The taste was okay too, though not, in my mind, much better than most ramen or Cup o Noodles or Maruchan type things. Really, it was like a squirt of sriracha in a cup of chicken ramen. Which is fine. Good. And this doesn't have MSG, so that's nice, and it comes in a bowl, so that's nice. There are flakes of veggies, and a couple pea-sized chunks of very spongy chicken. It took me a while to realize that the spongy stuff was chicken. Seems about right for this kind of product.<br /><br />I can't leave the office for lunch, so I'm always looking for something I can tuck in a desk drawer and actually enjoy. Given that it is in a microwaveable (non-styrofoam) bowl, and I like the idea of squirting sriracha in my ramen, this is a good option. Given how infrequently I'll use them, though, I might splurge and go for a much more expensive but slightly more gourmet bowl of noodles (Annie Chun, etc). On the other hand, if I were going to eat them more frequently, I might want to splurge and go for a more expensive but healthier alternative.<br /><br />If cheap, easy, and basically tasty are your priorities, this is probably a good option.

If you are like most of us and hog all 3 oz. yourself, your sodium intake will be a whopping 74% of the daily recommended maximum.<br /><br />The price is also a bit steep for a ramen product.

Their products usually deliver on lots of flavor and a decent textured noodles.  This Spicy Chicken flavor bowl of noodle soup would be the first instant variety of their noodles I've tried.<br /><br />The quality/texture of the noodles is similar to that of the Nissin brand noodles (better than Maruchan).  What sets this apart is the soup base flavor pack which delivers a more complex flavor and IMO tastes much better by comparison.  Since they give you the soup base pack, it gives you the option to add as much or as little flavoring as you'd like (whereas Cup O' Noodles, you're usually stuck with however much they give you).  It has the usual dehydrated veggies.  Other reviewers mention that there are little chunks of chicken... Reading the ingredients, I don't see a single mention of chicken besides chicken broth.<br /><br />Whereas the typical Cup o' Noodle will deliver 2.25-oz of unhealthy goodness, these bowls of noodle delivers 3.03oz.  The bowl of noodles wasn't that filling -- it'd be a perfect sized snack.  I don't know how they would conclude that this bowl would be equivalent to 2 servings.  The bowl delivers 380 calories (120 from fat), 14g of fat, 6g of saturated fat, 1780 mg of sodium, 56g of carbs, 2g of dietary fiber, and upwards of 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.<br /><br />On the packaging, it seems NongShim is trying to sell you on the product being healthy.  It touts ""No MSG added,"" ""30% less sodium than our regular product,"" ""0g trans fat.""  It has received some ""2011 Chef's Best Award"" and is ""Endorsed by Professional Chefs.""  Really?<br /><br />If you're buying this, don't expect this to be your answer to a healthy diet.  That said, if all you want is a quick and tasty snack, then NongShim will deliver what you're looking for."

It is not as aggressively hot as some Korean foods. I would call it mild to medium-minus in the spiciness arena. It has instructions for both microwave and ""Add boiling water"" methods of preparation. The one reason I would take off a star is that the picture on the top implies wholesome chunks of chicken and veggies. What you get are noodles that look like the noodles. Broth looks similar, too. The meat and veggie particles are tiny, 6mm chunks. You really won't have to sharpen the teeth for this stuff because the meat is so small.<br /><br />I am sure that there is some fine print saying it's a serving suggestion and you should add your chunks of meat and vegetables, but given that, they should have just not attempted to put the tiny freeze dried pellets in there.

You start to sweat a tiny bit, but it doesn't burn your mouth.<br /><br />Would I buy this regularly? Probably not, it isn't healthy enough, but would I buy one or two of these to stick in my office cabinet in case I have to work late and haven't made alternate dinner plans?

It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.

My granny used to fry up cornmeal biscuit-style in a cast iron skillet half filled with grease.  It was faintly salty and went perfectly with fried fish or chicken (or really just about anything she cooked.  Granny was a kitchen wonder.)<br /><br />This Jiffy Cornbread mix produces something entirely different.  It's sweet, almost like a grainy cake mix... and my family loves it.<br /><br />I usually make corn muffins with it, although on occasion I'll make Johnny Cakes for them for breakfast.  (These are like pancakes, no syrup though --at least not in our household as the little critters don't need any more sugar -- but melted butter or a fruit compote, finish them off perfectly.)<br /><br />To make the mix, all you need is one egg per box and a small amount of milk.  The recipe calls for 1/3 cup, but years of making this has taught me that the proper amount can vary a great deal.  The proper consistency should not be stiff, but not runny either.  It should flow slowly when the mixing bowl is tilted.<br /><br />A fun and convenient product.  You can be eating in under about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger"

I have eaten this product for 5-7 days a week for an entire year now.  The only time I didn't eat it was when I was on vacation.  Even then, I began to miss it after a week.  This product is amazing, and I've yet to tire of it.  Don't get me wrong, nothing can replace hashbrowns for breakfast in the morning in terms of flavor, but this product has helped me get into the best shape of my life while still enjoying the food I eat.<br /><br />The versatility of this product is amazing.  If I want a porridge consistency, I add slightly more water. If I want a bowl of something with more chew to it I add slightly less water. If I'm extra hungry , I'll cook it on the stovetop with frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn, broccoli, etc) with some garlic salt and hot sauce and you've got a savory and healthy dinner. If I'm in the mood for something sweet, I'll add bananas and drizzle in some honey. A bowl of this with an over-easy egg and you've got a very filling snack under 250 calories. With a regular meal, I'll sub out my starch (rice, pasta, bread) with this oatmeal for a healthy alternative. For me, I feel more full with oatmeal as the side dish probably because it fools my stomach with extra water weight but the fiber content keeps me feeling full or at least content until the next meal.<br /><br />Think outside the box and be open to new flavors and new textures, and you will thoroughly enjoy this product as much as I have, AND feel healthy doing so :)"

Since Costco doesn't carry them again. I just placed in another order and he had arrived quick!. When I first did a order the Oats was shipped Next Air via Las Vegas. That's real good service from Amazon. As for this product you can't compare it with anything you buy at Whole Foods nor regular Oatmeal.<br /><br />I've prepare this produce on the store and in two different type of Steamers. I don't use water method. I only use Silk or Blue Diamond Almond Milk Original on both. I use also Honey from local Farm which I wish Amazon would carry. You really don't have to use Honey but I like it so I use it. I set this to cook for 15 minutes in a Steam Oven I got from Amazon. I also have BPA Steamer I also got from Amazon. That one 11L  I can place 3x glass bowls (pyrex type) In the steamer with water only 3x can be cooked in 20 minutes. In Oven Steamer it's about 15 minutes with the Conventional Fan going. On the store using Ceramic cookware cooks pretty fast though. I like the steamer better because you get the puff of hot steam and the oats taste just right.<br /><br />I have bowl of this Oats every morning and look forward to the next day to have it!

I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor, no other fruit juices or artificial flavors mixed in to save money. As a result the cherry really does taste like cherry rather than a syrupy mess that has a hint of cherry. It has an authentic tart cherry mixed in the sweet, and you can taste the tart in the aftertaste. It even has a nice texture in the mouth. I know this sounds gushy but you have to try it!<br /><br />But it gets better, they used real cane sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup that is used in all the big brand sodas. As a result the sweet is more clean, not as overpowering or syrupy. The carbonation is medium, again here is an issue of too much carbonation can detract from the flavor. Caffeine free. The bottle is very cool and nostalgic with a painted on label and raised letters on the glass, reminding you they have been in business since 1891. All in all a perfect black cherry soda, best I have ever had."

Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.

It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude."

So, if you don't like it, fire up the blender, and whizz up your unseasoned hunk of meat (which is why it smells so intolerable to our tastes and smells,btw) into a goopy smelly jelly (very much like the jar you're commenting on here). Walk through the market trying to convince your other kids to keep their hands inside the basket everyone's riding in, you stand in line at the end of the day with your feet killing you in those do-me heels guarding the gum and chocolate bars from the other day-care escapees (now busily reaching OUTside the basket for the gum and chocolate), and then embarassingly survive (you hope) the wet (or otherwise and getting smelly) diaper aroma.

I keep a box at work and brew it in a cup and it tastes just fine, but it really does taste better when brewed in a cast iron teapot and sipped from a small cast iron cup. The teapot and cups are enameled on the inside so it must be a temperature thing because the tea never touches the iron.

16215,B000E8Y5CC,A1WE1DY3DFKDZI,m250,0,0,5,1333152000,A Truly Well-Balanced Green Tea,"For those of you wanting a high-quality, yet affordable green tea, you should definitely give this one a try. Let me first start by saying that everyone is looking for something different for their ideal tea, and I will attempt to briefly highlight what makes this tea attractive to a wide range of tea drinkers (whether you are a beginner or long-time tea enthusiast).  I have gone through over 12 boxes of this tea myself, and highly recommend it for the following reasons:<br /><br />-Quality:  First, this tea offers a smooth quality without any harsh or bitter after tones, which often turns people off from many green teas.  I've found my ideal brewing time to be between 3-5 minutes, giving you a light but flavorful cup of tea.  However, if you get distracted or forget about your tea and leave it brewing for 20+ minutes like I sometimes do, the quality of this tea is such that you still get a smooth but deeper flavor without the bad after taste.  The leaves themselves are whole leaves (not powdered stems, branches, etc commonly found in other brands), and the high-quality nylon bags also include chunks of tropical fruit and other discernible ingredients.  This isn't your standard cheap paper bag with a mix of unknown ingredients that have been ground down to a fine powder, leaving you to wonder what it is you are actually drinking.<br /><br />-Taste:  This tea offers notes of real pineapple and other hints of tropical fruits, yet isn't sweet or artificially flavored.  You have the foundation of a high-quality young hyson green tea for those true ""tea flavor"" lovers, yet the subtle hints of fruit make this a truly unique tea that I believe most will enjoy.  If you want it sweet, you can add sugar, splenda, etc but this really is not necessary as this tea offers an inherent warmth of flavor through it's ingredients.<br /><br />-Price:  This tea offers an excellent product at an exceptional price (especially when purchased at the prices Amazon offers).  Compared to other brands which I believe to be of similar quality (Mighty Leaf, Rishi, Two Leaves, etc.), Revolution offers a superior product at an outstanding price.  I have been purchasing this through Amazon for less per box than I would be paying at my local grocery store for Lipton, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful tea that is comparable, and even better than, other teas that are priced much higher.  It offers a well-balanced cup of green tea that I believe many will enjoy.  In terms of taste, quality, and price, I would argue you won't find a better combination that that offered by Revolution's Tropical Green Tea."

There is no way to make any choice during Amazon Prime buying (one click), or any other way i can find. So I am consuming this expensive stuff twice as fast to get the strength I want. Are you listening, Amazon? This proves to me that the arguments some make that buying in the store is better may have merit. if this were not a food item, already opened, I would return.<br /><br />So: WARNING: don't buy unless you are satisfied with any strength (Ironic a product this expensive would not pay more attention).<br /><br />Very, very disappointed!<br /><br />PS, the box labeling did not match the warning anyway, what I got was ""Light Roast"".

The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.  Im not sure what chicory is, but its a funny tasting coffee, fairly mild, and no matter how long I try to filter it to get it stronger/darker, the coffee just isnt the right amount of blackness.  So I turned to Trung Nguyen, and based on recommendations from internet, friends, and the website itself, this is one of (if not the) most popular blend.  Its got a great flavor full of nuttiness and sure presses better than du Monde (almost no grounds at bottom of cup), but its still not the ca phe sua da Im used to.  For one, the color is a definite brown, not black and it isnt strong.  Ill give the Creative #1 a try which says its a dark and strong robusta coffee (no blend), compared to this which is a blend of nearly everything.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great tasting coffee full of complex flavors that are beyond what I can describe, give this a try... you wont be disappointed to the least.  But, if you are looking for that really strong, jet black coffee that can strip paint off a car and wake up dirt, and that when mixed with condensed milk turns into a rich golden-brown concoction that is ca phe sua da, then you need to look elsewhere (like that Creative #1... possibly)."

Most food products, especially candy, is a rip-off from most Amazon sellers. However, the cereal is usually cheap. I think the 11.5oz was about $2.60 at Wal-Mart, but I paid  only $6.86 for the 1 package of 3 boxes here on Amazon, so that is about $2.29 for each box. That was a good deal, but now the page says $15 for 3 boxes, which is $5 a box. That is a rip for the 11.5oz box; you can get a 16oz box for only about $3.00 at Wal-Mart. So you have to watch the prices to see if it's cheaper or not.<br /><br />I was worried about the cereal not being fresh, but it is. My Lucky Charms were the new ones with the new marshmallows in them; currently it's the different colors of shooting stars. My boxes from Amazon have the same expiration date as the Frosted Flakes I bought at Wal-Mart, so that's a good thing. They taste good too (just in case there is other problems that could be wrong with them).<br /><br />So overall, check the prices to see if it is worth it, the prices change both in the store and online, alot (mostly they change online, though).

It's typically served in tiny, tulip-shaped glasses on small saucers. On a cold day, it's really warming, and it's even refreshing in summer.<br /><br />This tea is brewed in a two-part teapot, typically stainless steel with a big pitcher below for hot water and a smaller teapot on top for brewing a strong infusion of the tea. You set the teapot on top of the hot water to brew, then use the hot water to dilute the tea to desired strength. This is similar to the way Russian tea is brewed in a samovar.<br /><br />One thing about this tea; there is a lot of tea leaf dust in the package. To avoid a sort of off flavor contributed by the dust, it's easy to wash the leaves before brewing. I put the tea into a tea strainer, pour hot water over the leaves and discard the water. The leaves go into the pot for brewing. This really improves the flavor. It's not unusual to ""wash"" tea leaves; in China, tea is often made by throwing off the first water infusion and quickly re-infusing the wet leaves.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is more like Russian or China black tea--less snappy and tannic than Assam or Darjeeling."

I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally ""gummy"", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is ""no sugar added"" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.

The flavor really reminds me of strawberry-kiwi Snapple, which isn't a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.

It was a bit too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the kiwi nor was I wowed over by the taste of fresh strawberries. In fact, it was not that much different than Hanson's (although I like their taste better). It's 100% juice and carbonated - I figured it would either taste like sparkling cider or something similar orange soda, but neither is correct. It seems a bit heavier than cider and not as bubbly as orange soda. It does not really have a fresh fruit taste to it, and it is a bit heavy on the taste (e.g. not a subtle, light taste).<br /><br />Being 100% juice this could be a better choice than soda for kids. But with 135 calories and 11% of your RDA of sugar in a small 8 oz can, you are only improving over the dyes and additives. If the sugars concern you, compare this to Soda Club's drinks and you will be much happier there. However, it does sport 100% of RDA of Vitamin C - so it might have a slight cold-fighting benefit as well. For an adult, I would pass. The soda is sized for kids and that also means more waste generated. It would be too easy to chug 4 of these, and while being fat free, it is not easy on the calories.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like it but don't love it; however it was too small, had too many calories, and is too pricey for everyday consumption."

Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I really liked the light kiwi/berry taste more than the black cherry.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me."

The fruit names are silly anyway as they use a blend of several fruits.<br /><br />The carbonation is very light and the mixed fruit concentrate they use has a very pleasant flavor. There is no added sugar or fake sweeteners which seem to be in so many prepared beverages these days.

From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.<br /><br />I tasted this flavor as well as the ""black cherry"" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.

As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product. And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case it's really noticeable.  However, it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor -- the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice, that could be enough to ruin this drink for you."

Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the ""base"" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and/or grape fades to the background.<br /><br />Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the ""Apfelschorle"" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another ""regular"" soda.<br /><br />It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest ""health"" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price."

It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.

This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of the things I like, and the things that I did not like as much:<br /><br />First, the positive:<br /><br />The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor, that means Kiwi and Berry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable, which is very nice!<br /><br />The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.<br /><br />The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you, but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes, I know you can always pour out what is more than want, but how often does that happen?<br /><br />The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch, brief case, computer case, etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty, the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people.<br /><br />The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 135 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison, Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson, a serving size of Coca-cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So, do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!<br /><br />I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line, but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses, 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.<br /><br />Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.<br /><br />Ok, so overall, this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink, just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!<br /><br />The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count, the price, the volume you need to order, and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that, no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives)."

I'd describe it as a cross between those Dole Blended juices and soda water. Strange as it sounds it actually tastes good.<br /><br />Although I suppose it's slightly better for you than soda - The Switch doesn't use High-Fructose Corn Syrup - it's still full of calories and carbs.<br /><br />Still for people who generally don't drink soda such as myself but find themselves occasionally craving a carbonated beverage this is a nice alternative.<br /><br />The can is only 8.3 oz. which does make it considerably smaller than a can of soda. As long as you can stick to only drinking one you'll be slightly better off than drinking a typical non-diet soda.

Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice.

I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air.

By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's."

And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.<br /><br />The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice.

It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non-natural ingredient is ascorbic acid AKA Vitamin C as a preservative.

Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit ""misleading"" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that. I personally prefer a fruited flavored carbonated beverage anyhow over say a plain cola type flavored one.

If kiwi flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a berry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some kiwi and pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.

Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.

I do think that perhaps they could dilute it a bit with more carbonated water, as the flavor seems pretty concentrated.  This would probably cut down on the calories and add to the company's bottom line too, as water is cheaper than fruit juice.<br /><br />I also think that the underlying apple juice flavor is bit too pronounced.  I'd like to taste a bit more of the berry and/or kiwi versus apple.  But it is nice to see a carbonated beverage that's made from natural ingredients.

Schrader,0,0,3,1236038400,A Switch for the better?,"I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of ""junk"" food in our home, including sodas, so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it ""I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again"". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them, and don't expect it to be a great, healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs/sugar."

Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product, the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice.

It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans."

(With no Soybean con attached!!),"The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to ""make the switch"" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price."

And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all."

The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.<br /><br />The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3 - $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to bring the price down.<br /><br />If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.  You can mix your own for a lot less and not have the vitamin c aftertaste."

(I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.

16860,B001LGGH40,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,1,3,1,1237420800,"At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For","UPDATE: April 3, 2009<br />I ""ordered"" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: ""A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE."" Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be ""healthy."" Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The ""diet"" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of ""off the diet.""  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a ""wolf in lamb's clothing"" for those who consider themselves ""heath conscious.""<br /><br />The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:<br /><br />""The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]""<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as ""Carb"" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?"

The Switch also provides a huge sugar hit via the fructose in the highly concentrated juices and has 135 calories in only 8.3 fluid ounces. Of 34 grams of carbohydrates, 33 are from sugar.<br /><br />I don't carbo load, so it doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'd rather eat the real fruit and get the fiber and other ingredients, or else have a less sweet drink. I tried using it as a concentrate and mixing 1 part soda to 3 parts water, which made it drinkable for me; although this worked well, I'd still probably stick with other beverages.<br /><br />Recommended, only if you want to ease your way off of unhealthy sodas and like very sweet drinks.<br />***"

Edwards,1,1,4,1236038400,Flavorful and Refreshing,"The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit beverage is certainly different than what one expects to get out of a carbonated drink. Because it is 100% fruit juice, as opposed to fruit flavored, it is much more refreshing than the typical fruit flavored sparkling beverage. At 135 calories and 34 grams of carbohydrates - 33 grams of sugar - it might be a little heavy for the health or weight conscious. The only other drawback might be that the carbonation flattens out the depth of the flavor just a little. Nonetheless, Switch is a tasty and refreshing carbonated fruit beverage."

Nutritionally, the drink contains more sugar and calories than an equivalent 8 oz serving of soda or iced tea, but these seem in-line with other juice beverages. This drink makes me curious why Snapple didn't branch into carbonated fruit beverages, but perhaps the reason may have something to do with cost.

These ""craft"" sodas seem to be the  non-alcoholic equivalent of the micro-brew craze that seems to be leveling off.<br />The fact that the product is actually fruit juice, gives me high-hopes that the corn syrup and chemically dependant soda industry can innovate with solid and natural products.<br />The small size is also a benefit, in that it's adequate for this type of beverage.  We've become a society of excess, and sodas, colas and other soft-drinks have not been immune,  The Switch brings us back to the days of reasonable and healthy serving sizes and hopefully consumers will take note.<br />An all-around excellent product that I will be looking for in stores."

Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the ""flavor"".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?

I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.<br /><br />TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.<br /><br />BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.<br /><br />VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just aren't there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.  Save your money"

At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the ""Switch"" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also.

Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.

In fact, the can I tried actually had a metallic flavor to it--I don't know if it was actually picking up the tang from the container, or if it's just the poor flavor profile of the beverage. I really don't care enough to try it again to find out.<br /><br />Also, I don't know why they're calling this line SWITCH.

The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect.

Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say ""no *added* sugar"", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying ""no sugar"" or ""no sucrose"" (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one."

It was lunchtime, and one of the guys asked if I would like a cup of coffee. I've been disappointed pretty regularly, but something in his eyes told me to say ""yes"". They poured it out of a big 5# bag and brewed it in a big drip maker.<br />I had no particular expectations, but when I took the first sip I was immediately enchanted.<br />This is very good! I exclaimed. What is it?<br />""This is what we grow here, the B-grade"", he said...<br />I have been drinking a cup every morning since then, no matter what the distance, no matter what the price.<br />This is my new ""best coffee in the world"".

There were 7 ravioli in the whole can. That is a bit skimpy, but since it was going to be the only thing I had, I ate the whole can and was quite satisfied.  The sauce is much more flavorful than the Chef-Boyardee regular beef ravioli that I had as a kid, and tastes more Italian.<br /><br />The WHOLE can has 480 calories, 10 gms of fat, 78 gms of carbs, and 18 gms of protein.  There are also 10 gms of fiber in the whole can.  The serving size says that  the can is about 2 servings.  Hmm.... maybe for a young kid, or if there was a good salad, and fruit on the side, but I have too much pain to make full meals.  I have to make do.  There are 1 1/2 cups of vegetables per can- so that's good.<br /><br />No preservatives or MSG.

I buy them because they're cheap and convenient. I don't buy them in the expectation of great pasta dishes although it's always nice if one of these products is better than my expectations. The overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli was one that was better than my expectations. Currently, this is my ranking for the products I have actually sampled:<br /><br />1. Overstuffed Italian sausage ravioli<br />2. Jumbo spaghetti and meatballs<br />3. Overstuffed beef ravioli<br />4. Beefaroni with whole grain pasta<br /><br />This product distinguishes itself from things like the Beefaroni by having real identifiable neat. It is better than the beef ravioli because the sausage is actually flavorful and tasty whereas the beef ravioli is bland. it is roughly on a par with the spaghetti except that I like the texture and taste better than the spaghetti (but my girlfriend prefers the spaghetti, which she gobbles up in no time).<br /><br />This ravioli is about as good as we're going to get in a can. Canning pasta faces one major chalkenge: it tastes like pasta stored in a can. Chef Boyardee hasn't found a way around this, and I'm not sure there is one.<br /><br />If you buy this product, be aware that each can has two servings, and each serving has plenty of sodium. Eating one full can will leave little leeway for more during the day if you have high blood pressure.<br /><br />However, I think this product is tasty enough that I will be buying more. That isn't true of the overstuffed beef ravioli.<br /><br />PS: Some reviewers claim that Amazon is selling seconds because some cans were dented. This is a very infrequent occurrence for me, and I tend to doubt that Amazon is selling something graded this way. Besides, I often see supermarkets selling dented cans--even more often than Amazon."

And I am not usually a big fan of canned ravioli except for a quick lunch sort of thing. I just recently came across this variety in the market here and gave it a try.  Not only is the ravioli truly overstuffed, but the sausage they use is very tasty without being hot and spicy.  I have actually baked these with Parmesan cheese and some added garlic and onion for 15 min and had people rave about them being home made.  If you can't find this in your market, its a good deal here on Amazon by the case, and with free shipping.  Excellent home made flavor, and highly recommended... : )"

It also has chunks of the same sausage, exactly like boxed pizza toppings, mixed in with the sauce.  All in all, it's a great quickie lunch as is or a very decent dinner when prepared with the right sides.  A trick I learned as a youth when eating the classic ravioli for lunch most days, mix in a single slice of good quality American or Swiss sandwich cheese and carefully stir it into the sauce as it melts.  It adds another level of creaminess to the sauce and it makes it ""done"".  Serve it with some crusty bread."

17012,B004GI0I68,A6GMEO3VRY51S,microjoe,2,2,5,1294272000,made in Michigan since 1866,"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."

As I've been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA"">Espresso</a> option for ages, I've decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we're working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O"">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso's instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn't do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I'd say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I'd say there's a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, 'Well, you're comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who've been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you're missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand's mild espressos just weren't quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!"

17083,B003CH4Q5I,A30POH7POLQ78U,"C. G. Maupin ""cgmaupin""",4,4,5,1278979200,A Successful Experiment,"When I ordered this product, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I kind of had in mind a ""curry ketchup"" (literally just ketchup with a curry aftertaste), but the description made me think that wasn't quite on the mark.  But since I've been happy with Maya Kaimal's other products, and as a lover of both Indian food and ketchup, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />My suspicion that this wouldn't just be ""ketchup plus some curry flavor"" was borne out.  Honestly, it's a little difficult to describe.  It's as though someone scrapped the idea of ketchup and decided to start over and build a new ketchup out of some new ingredients and some old ones.  That's a weird description, I know, so I'll go into a little more detail.  It's just that nearly every ketchup you buy is basically slight variations on a theme.  This is different, but still identifiably ketchup.<br /><br />The spicy ketchup isn't smooth like most ketchups; it has a definite texture to it.  It's very slightly thicker than most ketchups, but not so much that you use it any differently.  It's not as tart as ketchup tends to be, nor as sweet as some (particularly ones that use sugar instead of HFCS).  It has a pleasant tomato flavor with a hint of smokiness and a definite Indian flair.  But all of the flavors are very, very integrated.  Like I said before, this isn't ""ketchup plus.""  It has a very unified, if complex, flavor.  And for those who are worried about the ""spicy"" part of the name, this ketchup has a little bit of bite to it, about as much heat as a one-star curry.<br /><br />I've tried it on a variety of different foods that I normally eat with ketchup and I admit my success has been mixed.  I tried it first with some fast food french fries, which was decidedly underwhelming.  It wasn't bad; it's just that it was more novel than good.  I tried it later with tater tots, which was much better.  I've had it on an ordinary cheeseburger, which was good but it didn't wow me like it wowed one of my friends.  But the two biggest successes I've had with it have been the most surprising.<br /><br />One, this ketchup is excellent on a hot dog.  Yes, I know you aren't ""supposed"" to put ketchup on hot dogs, but I don't like mustard or relish and I don't always want a chili dog.  And for what it's worth, I think the spicy Indian ketchup actually ""goes with"" hot dogs better than ordinary ketchup (which isn't to say I like it more, per se, just that the flavors seem more complementary).<br /><br />And two, I just tried this ketchup tonight on some black pepper and bleu cheese hamburgers I picked up at the store.  Again, I didn't expect much but tried it on a whim.  Amazing.  The black pepper really brought out the spiciness of the ketchup.  And the pockets of bleu cheese in the burgers... I really did not expect bleu cheese to go well with Indian-themed ketchup, but the combination was just incredible.  A stronger bleu cheese might not work as well, but this was fairly mild.<br /><br />I've tried a few different variant ketchups in the past (did I mention I really like ketchup?), but I rarely find anything that's worth getting again.  Not only am I glad I bought this bottle of spicy Indian ketchup, but when it's gone I plan on buying another.  I still use my Heinz, mind you.  The two ketchups are not interchangeable.  But they do seem to be good on largely the same things, and the spicy Indian ketchup is great for adding just a bit of flair to your food.  Highly recommend."

So this product fit the bill perfectly. I agree with the very accurate description of the ketchup by the previous reviewer. Just that little bit of kick and the thicker texture make it amazingly versatile. I don't eat much beef, but I have tried it on a burger and it was great. But my absolute favorite use is on fish--particularly the meatier types of fish, like tuna, that can get a bit dry if grilled.It has also replaced barbecue sauce for me on pork chops.

Lamb liver is a great flavor, but my pups love all the flavors equally, it seems. Each treat is about 1"" wide and 1"" to 1-1/2"" in length. Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess. They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients. The shelties love them! I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.  My parents' little pom-terrier mix has a special place in her heart for anything liver, so these were well received (*snarf snarf snarf*) by that pup too.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything. Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way. I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training.

I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).<br /><br />The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually break it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT!

17148,B003VVL8NS,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""",10,10,5,1286323200,Delightful Revival of an Old Favorite (if wrapper is all wrong),"I definitely remember buying Turkish Taffy in all four flavors (Vanilla, Bananna, Chocolate, and yes, Strawberry) for $0.05 at our local drugstore when I was a wee lad. I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or ""blunt"" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really."
17149,B003VVL8NS,A2U61OLT76XK5I,S. K. Buchanan,2,2,5,1294963200,I've Been Waiting 36 Years!,"The last place I bought a Bonomo's Turkish Taffy bar was at a 7-11 convenience store in Orlando, FL. It was 1974 and I was 14 years old. Devastating, I know!<br /><br />As a military brat, service member and spouse, I have looked for genuine Turkish Taffy in nearly every corner of the earth only to discover that the recipe had been sold and then shelved without a single batch being made. I've made several attempts along the way to find something similar but all fell way short of satisfying. Plain salt-water taffy was okay but it was always too soft and airy. Then there was Doscher's French Chew taffy bar that purportedly is as close to Turkish Taffy as it gets. All I can say is, ""ICK!""<br /><br />Now, before we get to the bottom line here you need to know that unlike so many others folks, cracking a Bonomo's was not necessarily an option in FL unless you took it home and stuck it in the fridge for a while (longer than the recommended five minutes). I suppose that might work if you lived next door to the 7-11 but who could wait that long? So, before leaving the store, I would already be peeling back the wrapper on my taffy bar and sinking my teeth in only to find that my teeth would be locked shut in the thick gooey taffy. Mmmm - Heaven!<br /><br />Back in the present, I finally received my box of Bonomo's Vanilla Taffy today - the ONLY flavor worth sinking my teeth into. Unfortunately, there was no way I'd be able to do so. Living in the Blue Ridge Mountains in NC, my taffy had apparently been sitting on a truck stuck in the snow for several days before they finally were able to make it up to our house. To my great disappointment the first bar out of the box was already cracked. I had no choice but to rip open the wrapper like the 14 year old I wish I still were and slip the very first cracked piece ever into my mouth with much anticipation.<br /><br />I was not disappointed!<br /><br />It's funny how the taste of certain foods remain with you, no matter how long it's been since you last had them. Like the original Liege Belgian waffles we used to get in the market a few blocks from our home in Brussels when I was eight years old. I returned to Brussels and that market several times in the late nineties and sure enough - those waffles were just as sweet, sticky with syrup from the partially dissolved ""perle"" sugar.<br /><br />And so it is with the new Bonomo's vanilla flavored Turkish Taffy. Thirty six years later and still, unmistakably genuine Bonomo's Turkish Taffy. Now to find a way to soften it just enough to get my teeth stuck in it again.<br /><br />I am now contemplating whether I should buy several cases of this stuff - enough to last 36 years perhaps. You know, just in case they stop making it again."

I searched for them for years, they were a favorite of my mothers in the fifties and mine also. I found out they stopped being made in 1981. What a letdown. Then I discovered them in a catalog that deals in nostalgia. I don't know when they started making them again.Of course, I checked on line and found them much cheaper at Amazon. The price is right and the candy great. You smack the bar on a counter to crack it up to eat. It comes in other flavors, too. Only problem for me is that I would prefer to buy a box of assorted flavors instead of one box of 24 of one flavor, but since it's vanilla it's okay for now."

I LOVED that.  Then the aftertaste kicked in; a strong, intriguing flavor that was not at all unpleasant. I don't know how to exactly describe it, but it did make me go back for a second cup; I wanted to try it iced too!  It was top notch iced with some chocolate; it has a strong enough flavor but in a light roast so you don't get that burnt flavor, but it REALLY stood out with the chocolate flavor with it.  It seemed to be very low acid as well, it didn't eat at my stomach the way that the Sumatra coffee I had been drinking lately had.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I can justify the price of the coffee for the flavor, but I suspect I will be back for more!

Even my most staunch ""I hate healthy food"" critic, my teenaged son admitted he liked it.  My only complaint would be the price which I think is too high and when you add shipping it becomes a luxury item.

RiceSelect Royal Blend rice is for those of us who like flavorful mixed grains, with the firmer consistency only possible with long cook rice.  The nutrition in this grain combo is phenomenal and the taste is fabulous.  I buy the 4 jar package and it comes out cheaper than if I could actually talk my grocer into carrying it.  The flavors complement a gumbo, spanish rice,  a bacon/ham and pecan casserole, or anything with a stronger flavor even oriental and indian dishes.  For milder dishes like Indian Butter Chicken, you might like your regular white, basmati, or jasmine rices, although I generally use these whole grains for almost everything.  Jars were package very well, packed for shipping very well, and shipped promptly.  Rice lovers will love this product."

It has a lot of ""crunch"" left in it after cooking.  The Soft Wheat & Rye Berries add to that crunchy texture as does the wild rice.  And this rice has a lot more flavor than plain, white rice.

The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.

They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product.

A careful review of the contents of the Hershey's Mounds Bar :NGREDIENTS: CORN SYRUP; SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE ( CHOCOLATE; SUGAR; COCOA; MILK FAT; COCOA BUTTER; SOY LECITHIN; PGPR, EMULSIFIER) ; COCONUT; SUGAR; SALT; NATURAL & ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR; HYDROLYZED MILK PROTEIN; SODIU, M METABISULFITE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; SULFUR DIOXIDE, TO MAINTAIN FRESHNESS; CARAMEL COLOR; MILK  followed by  the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar<br /><br />Ingredients: Coconuts, Rice Syrup, Dark Chocolate (Sugar, Cocoa Butter, Chocolate, Soy Lecithin, Natural Vanilla)<br />clearly<br />exemplifies the purity & quality of the product.<br /><br />Though the visual is not as attractive as the Mounds Bar, the absence of garbage ingredients makes the contents of the Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar  far more nutritious, &  its taste far superior. Any time I find myself licking the wrapper,  it's an Oskri Dark Chocolate Coconut Bar!  I seriously try to eat only one a day.  I say try!"

Oskri charges more for Dark Chocolate than for their regular Coconut Bar. I did not feel it was right for them to charge extra for Dark Chocolate when that is not what they deliver. They may not even have a Dark Chocolate Bar, judging by what they shipped to me. It is Milk Chocolate. Anyone who sees these bars will immediately know they are Milk and not Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />I am very disappointed since I no longer eat Milk Chocolate. I am totally addicted to Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />Update 4/25/2012<br />I was wrong about the Chocolate. I opened a second bar and it was Dark Chocolate. I believe some of the bars were melted during the time the package traveled across California during a heat wave.

I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Won't buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup."

Yep the answer is they all go amazingly well with this chile lime seasoning. Sprinkling this stuff on top of wip cream is also a surprizing treat. Its great in a brownie batter, and is a wonderfull marinade for grillables. Its also perfect if you need to add a tart zing to a dish without adding any liquid. Toss french fries, chips, or any other fried foods immediately in this seasoning, after it comes out of the oil. It adds the acid that fried foods so desperately need, while still keeping them crispy. Who wants to mush up the batter with lime juice, well I use to, but not anymore?<br /><br />This seasoning will make you explore the boundaries of savory and sweet combinations (since it labeled itself a fruit seasoning), some will be delightful and others will be horrible failures.

I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it.

I was told I had to cut back on caffeine, and I don't need the calories associated with sugared soft drinks.

I like the hint of raspberry flavor, and find that I can drink quite a lot of it during the day without getting bored.  I mix up a 32-oz water bottle of the stuff, using 2 packets of mix.  This seems to work well, especially when i down 2-3 bottles of the stuff per day.<br /><br />I also like the lemonade flavor, and the cherry pomegranate.  The strawberry - not so much.  It's their ""energy"" formulation, so it contains some ""extras"" that I think add to a slightly bitter ""sharp"" flavor - and it contains caffeine, which sort of defeats the purpose of my drinking Crystal Light in the first place.<br /><br />I've managed to lose 23 pounds in a little over 3 months using this along with cooking everything from ""scratch"" - no processed foods, lots of fruits and veggies, fresh meats and fish.

One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:<br /><br />Product Description<br />Every refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light ""Natural"" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />""Natural"" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, ""natural"" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does ""taste"" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here.

17270,B000GPXRRW,A2R6RA8FRBS608,Matthew G. Sherwin,3,3,5,1185580800,Vanilla caramel Coffee-mate is TOPS in my book !!!,"Vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate makes for an excellent milk or cream substitute for people who want a cup of coffee, cocoa or even tea when they don't have access to a refrigerator to keep milk or cream on hand. Coffee-mate therefore comes in very handy in many workplaces, naturally, but it adds so much extra flavor to your beverage that you just might wind up using this instead of milk or cream even if you do have access to a refrigerator with milk or cream in it!<br /><br />Coffee-mate is easy enough to use--just add three or four teaspoons full of it into your cup of coffee, tea or whatever beverage you want to sweeten with this wonderful vanilla caramel taste.<br /><br />I would use vanilla caramel Coffee-mate by the expiration date on the bottom of the plastic container; and the container gives you simple instructions for turning this powdery substance into liquid just in case you want to do that.<br /><br />The nutrition label claims it contains no trans-fats but I notice that it contains partially hydrogenated oils. This may indicate that the trans-fats in Coffee-mate are present but very negligible.<br /><br />Have further questions? Just give them a call or surf on over to their website. They provide you with the website address and a toll free number if you have more questions about vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate.<br /><br />Overall, vanilla caramel flavored Coffee-mate provides an excellent, sweet tasting substitute for milk, cream and anything else that contains lactose. You may want to use it to sweeten your coffee, tea or cocoa even if you have access to fresh refrigerated milk that you can use. It's THAT good.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"

I don't have to add extra chocolate chips to this mix to get the richness I want in a chocolate brownie.  Another plus is that this mix works just as well with substitutions (I use canola oil instead of butter).  I even baked one batch using applesauce and yogurt instead of oil (moist, fat, brownies were the result).  I like that I can ""de-fat"" them if I want to do so!  I've tried almost every GF brownie mix on the planet and this one is the BEST!  One strange recommendation in the directions is that you freeze the brownies for an hour for best results.

So, sometimes, for convenience, you want a mix.<br /><br />One box will make an 8"" square dish of gluten-free brownies that I readily serve to my wheat-eating friends (and I get very positive feedback).  You want to take the brownies from this mix from ""good"" into the stratosphere of ""awesomeness""?  Here's my tip, stolen from the Paula Deen website.  Mix up the brownie mix.  Pour half into a baking pan.  Chop up a toffee bar (the supersize symphony bar works well) and spread over the bottom half of the batter.  If you're feeling like a super-delicious extra-heavy brownie, just lay down the whole bar and get another half of a second bar to make a complete layer.  Then pour in the other half of the batter and bake according to the directions.  You will soon be eating the best from-a-mix brownie you've ever eaten, gluten-free or otherwise."

It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its [...] effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas. White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea.

We have four kids, and I eat a low carb diet, so we eat a lot of peanut butter.  When I saw this 35-pound bucket offered with free SuperSaver shipping, I leaped!<br /><br />The product itself is very good - just like Fisher's other nuts and products, it has a great flavor, and it's creamy and not too salty.  The lid on the bucket fits well, so I can reseal it after transferring some of it to smaller jars for the kitchen.  It's a little messy having to dip it out that way, but well worth it when I save $1-2 per pound over buying store brand peanut butter at the grocery.  I spray a one cup measuring cup with cooking spray, to keep it from sticking too much, and use a rubber scraper to get it all in the jar without any waste.<br /><br />I notice the price has risen from $60 to $90 since I bought my bucket.  I probably wouldn't have purchased this bucket at $90, but I'll be watching the price and will buy it again when it's a great bargain like when I purchased it."

It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a ""bite"" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more ""authentic"" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it."

The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.

I had been buying an organic blend that I thought was good until I tried this. I was hooked but this was almost like buying printer ink, very expensive. The 80 pk is about two pounds of coffee. Amazon pricing is $48 dollars which equals $24 dollars a pound. This is pricey, you are paying for the convenience. Other retailers mark this up even more making Amazon look cheap. I found this at BJ's wholesale club for $37 dollars. Not that much cheaper but it is a savings. Bottom Line: The Keurig Brewer is a fantastic coffee machine that works best with the K-cups.

I expect products labeled with the Newman's Own label to be good (or at least worth trying).  They advertise it as being a medium roast, and it's not.  When you look at the package it says 'regular' 'medium roast' and 'extra bold'.  How can it be all three?  I like my coffee strong, but not burned (think regular Starbucks) or bitter, and this coffee is both.  I love other bold brands like Deidrich's French roast, but really don't like this coffee.

Then I tweaked the cup size a bit and found a nice blend.  I personally like this on the 10oz setting.  This gives the best balance of flavor and fullness.  The key here is this is a medium roast, even though it is listed as 'bold', it is more of a medium through and through.<br /><br />The flavors are good.  There is a nice tail on this one.  It is a tiny bit on what I consider to be the tart side.  Not necessarily bitter though.  However, I am the only one in my family still drinking this one.  They've all moved on to the dark roast all the time.  For me, I like slightly less strength for my first cup of the day.  Yes, I do drink 3 cups a day...

Always very high quality ingredients, very tasty blends. This is one of the 5-star varieties. Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full-bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big ""traditional remedy"" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.<br /><br />Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!"

Even one sip brought relief to my throat and by the time I had finished the mug, the coughing was over and done with.  I immediately went on a search for the product and finally found it in the gourmet section of a local grocery.  Then, I found it on Amazon... and a LOT less expensive!  BREATHE DEEP tea has not only helped me with my respiratory issues (asthma, bronchitis, chronic sinus congestion, etc.), I've shared it with family members and friends who are also amazed at what one cup of BREATHE DEEP tea can do.  I'm getting ready to order my supply for the upcoming winter.  I do NOT want to be caught without this in the cupboard."

It has been one of the few natural remedies that works really well for me.<br /><br />If you can find a single box of this to try first, I would suggest that before buying a bulk amount like this.  The taste is very herbal, and many of the ingredients have a strong flavor on their own.  In general, I am not a fan of liquorish... at all, but I really like the taste of this tea.  The other flavors balance out the liquorish root really well and it comes across as more of an anise seed flavor.<br /><br />I've also handed this tea off to family members getting over a head cold, and they have seen good results with this tea."

And it's great for those of us with acidic stomachs who are not supposed to have black tea or mint (there is a little mint in this, but only enough to give you a hint of the flavor).

This chocolate has a variety of flavors - midnight crunch with quinoa, dark chocolate mint, cacao, etc .  I have tried all three and they are excellent.

All the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite.  Both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener.  Great job designing a healthy snack for young children.

Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar make the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 ""The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames.""<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available.

17730,B000Z978SS,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,kalyson,91,94,5,1218326400,Great stuff!,"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their ""100% satisfaction guarantee"". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item ""powdered"".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products."
17731,B000Z978SS,A1GALZCXD8FHOR,Daniel L Edelen,56,59,5,1243641600,"A perfect, natural sugar substitute","Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended."

My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.<br /><br />I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or ""laxative"" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
17734,B000Z978SS,A1SO1PGDNVMLXC,kalyson,15,17,5,1264377600,"Great product!  From corn, not birch","Erythritol tastes like sugar, just like xylitol.  It is not, however, toxic to pets as xylitol is.  Also, it does not have the gastrointestinal effects (bloating, gas, etc.) that can come with intake of large quantities, as is the case with xylitol.  Both are quite safe for people, however.  Dogs cannot eat chocolate, either, due to toxicity, so xylitol is just another thing that works for us but not for them.  But erythritol is safe for both people and animals.<br /><br />The downside to erythritol is that it costs more than xylitol and is only 70% as sweet as sugar, whereas xylitol is closer to being the same sweetness as sugar.<br /><br />I haven't had much luck baking with either of them -- but maybe others have had different experiences.<br /><br />Both xylitol and erythritol taste great - I can't tell them from sugar.  Stevia is also a healthy sugar alternative, but it definitely has a taste -- not pleasant in large amounts (bitter).<br /><br />Not all brands of xylitol and erythritol are equal.  Many come from birch trees which often is extracted using sulfuric acid.  The ones from NOW Foods are from corn, which does not require sulfuric acid.<br /><br />This is a good company and I have been very happy with them.  On the other hand, I did not have a good experience with Emerald Forest's products or customer service.  Their products come from birch trees and have a very unpleasant odor.  I much preferred the products from this company - they taste great and don't really have an odor."
17735,B000Z978SS,A35BK88JWUFX5Q,emjacob,6,6,4,1320537600,Great but Grainy,After using erythritol in several recipes I've found that it tastes far better than alternate sweeteners like Splenda.  It is a little less sweet than sugar or Splenda so you might have to add a bit more to get the same taste.  The only problem with erythritol is that it doesn't break down easily in frostings or recipes that don't require some amount of cooking or baking.  I've found running it through a blender to break it down into a powder or mixing it with warm water before mixing it in removes the grainy texture and makes the erythritol easier to work with.
17736,B000Z978SS,A3LULJF2MQSAAQ,Ruben Miranda,5,5,5,1260489600,As close to sugar as you can get without the calories,"This is expensive in the stores, paid $10.00 for 35 packets and usually needed at least 2 packets.<br />Buying it this way is much cheaper.<br />It tastes just like sugar with no aftertaste. As far as I know it is safe and has none of the controversial issues surrounding stuff like sucralose and saccharin.  It is not as sweet as sugar so you may need to use a little more.<br />How cool, no calories, tooth decay or elevated blood sugar levels, just sweetness."
17737,B000Z978SS,A134HFABW6BMZL,Pericombobulation53,3,3,5,1337040000,Just wish it were cheaper,"Since switching to a low carb diet, Erythritol and Xylitol have become my friends.  Each has its own pros and cons, so I mix them.  Erythritol doesn't cause as much gas, but it leaves a cool sensation in the mouth which can be distracting.  Xylitol is good for your teeth, but may make some people feel like the Hindenburg.  Both taste sweet and don't leave an aftertaste.  So I figure the best bet is to buy a bag of each and mix them together.  Note that both these products are small crystals which do not dissolve very easily in liquid.  The best way around this is to pulverize them with a coffee grinder.  Just a few seconds will break up the crystals into a powder which will dissolve just fine."
17738,B000Z978SS,AH1R6TSMBZL4U,SRS,5,6,3,1276128000,"Not a good flavor, Xylitol is much better","I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong ""cotton candy"" aftertaste.<br /><br />The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the ""cotton candy"" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol."

I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee."

I first tried this brownie mix when I was planning my Christmas gift baking last year and a cousin announced she had to eat gluten free. I was hesitant to invest in a lot of expensive ingredients I might or might not use again, so I purchased a box of this brownie mix, then tried to think of ways of how to doctor it up and make it into something that I hoped would be special.<br /><br />I came up with an idea, shipped the brownies off to her, and waited to hear if they were any good.  (I warned her that it was my first experiment in gluten free baking.)  Well, let me tell you...that grown woman went through the entire batch of brownies in under two days - they were a hit!<br /><br />I tried another recipe this week for her birthday, which is today, and the results are just in:  in her words, ""You hit it out of the park with these!""  Happily, my reputation as a fabulous baker now extends into the gluten-free realm...with a little help from Arrowhead Mills!<br /><br />Here are two ideas to get you started:<br /><br />#1 - Get a box of this brownie mix, and also a box of the Arrowhead Mills chocolate chip cookie mix.  Prepare each mix according to the directions on the boxes.  Place little mounds of the cookie dough randomly in a 9 X 13 pan, then spoon the brownie mixture around the mounds to fill in the empty spaces.  Bake.<br /><br />#2 - Prepare brownie mix according to directions and pour into a 9 X 13 pan.  In a separate bowl, mix 8 oz. of cream cheese, one egg, and a tsp. of vanilla.  Drop dollops of the cream cheese batter onto the brownie mix; run a knife or spatula through to give a swirled, marble effect. Bake.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying this again; I have a lot more recipe ideas I want to try out on her, and may even offer fancy gluten free brownie creations to my customers."

The only better bulk price one can get (that I'm aware of) is at the Haribo factory in Bonn, Germany (and if you like Gummibaerchen, I suggest you visit).<br /><br />As for the candies themselves, Frogs are not my favorite.  An entire bag of them yields no variety at all.  If Amazon starts selling the classic bears (which are a multitude of flavors and are smaller and easier to chew up) I would buy those over Frogs in a hot second.  (The sugar-free kind are not the classic version, and some people have digestive problems with the artificial sweetener. NB this is not the case with Frogs - they are sugar-sweetened.)<br /><br />A note about the Haribo ""catchphrase"": the German ""Haribo macht Kinder froh und Erwachsene ebenso"" is better translated ""Haribo makes kids happy / and adults likewise"".

All good but my preference is the hot tea. A great afternoon treat.<br />The only drawback is that you pay shipping per box and the shipping is higher than the cookies, but still worth it."

Serve over rice.<br /><br />The first batch I made was a tad on the watery side, I had used a knife to chop the onions and powdered coconut milk for the cream. I thought it was ok but the rest of the family loved it.<br /><br />Understanding the dish a bit better the second time around I used the food processor for the onion, this gave a more even smooth paste like base. Then I used coconut cream on a 1:1 basis for water. That turned out MUCH thicker and tastier.

Reynolds,2,2,2,1328572800,Overpowering spices,"I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first."

Here's a recipe to try:  a few frozen bananas (for chill and body), about a  cup of crunchy peanut butter, about half a cup of almond or regular or soy milk (more milk if you like a thinner shake), a scoop of this cocoa, and blend.

But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore-- just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute-- long enough for my bread to be toasted- so no big deal.<br />I'm lazy and always hungry-- but this absolutely works for me.<br />I'm so delighted to have discovered it."

We have been using it every night in smoothies (peanut butter/banana) and it is so good. I've even tried it on a sandwich. The taste is pleasant. It tastes more like an actual peanut. I would definately recommend.

It actually tastes REALLY good! I was very impressed! I've used it so far by itself on toast, and in a PB & J sandwich and I'm very happy with it. I get to enjoy peanut butter again for half the points!!!! If you're on a diet and love peanut butter, definitely try this! The first time I added too much water, which made it way too creamy, but since then I've lessened the water and it has a natural peanut butter consistency."

I have been hearing about it and people that are on a strict diet trying to lose weight often rave about it.  To me I will never use it as just straight peanut butter on a cracker or bread.  I do believe it is good to put in smoothies, if you want peanut butter in your smoothie.  You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure-obviously it is missing the FAT- but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it..."

It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of ""gluey"" but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes."

As an extreme health junkie, I understand the notion behind moderation, but I admit that it's a bit hard to obey when it comes to peanut butter. Because of this, I haven't eaten peanut butter in a long time (about 3 years!)<br /><br />About 2 months ago, PB2 entered my life and I could NOT have been any happier with this product. It's so amazingly yummy and perfect! I use it in powder form for my smoothies or I add water and some cinnamon and use it as a spread for crackers. I also use it for other foods like my baked tofu or sauteed shrimp. I love that you can adjust the consistency depending on the amount of water you add. Sometimes I can make it really thick by adding a little bit of water or more smooth with more water. I love that flexibility.

But when it arrived it was a huge let down. Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried."
17939,B008ZRKZSM,ATJN4KEHJBOC8,"KatyKatIL ""KatyKat""",1,1,5,1334188800,Powdered peanut butter??  YES!!,"Well, I have to say that I thought this would be pretty bad. I admit it.<br />Deconstituted peanuts - wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl<br />left when we were through!<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.<br />I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it). If you are trying to watch your<br />fat intake, this is the PB to eat.<br /><br />I have ordered a jar of the PB2 Chocolate tonight. I simply have to try it too. I hope it is as good<br />as this one!  YUM!  Now, I wonder if the same company might want to make this in almond or cashew<br />versions?!  *HINT TO THE COMPANY*"

It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price.

But, I love peanut butter but hate the calories, so I decided to take all the good reviews to heart and give it a go. I was honestly shocked when I mixed up my first tablespoons. It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more.

They add just the right amount of sugar to this product. The total ingredients are peanuts, salt and sugar. 45 cals for 2 TBS. Also, I tried this in Greek yogurt (1 TBS to one container of yogurt) and it was really good and peanuty! You have to try it to believe it. I'm going to try the chocolate version next.

My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it .

I mitigate this by adding a very thin layer (I have a problem with putting WAY too much PB on) of real PB to my bread and then supplementing with the powdered stuff.  It works better that way, I think, and I don't get all the calories from using all regular PB.  I probably wouldn't buy this from amazon again because of the price, but I'm glad I tried it, and if it's on sale at whole foods or something I'd buy it.<br /><br />Oh, be careful when you're opening the jar for the first time...no sudden movements or you'll be covered in PB powder, and at this price, every grain is precious!"

It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).

If someone in the house balks at the taste, you can toss in a dash of fine sea salt or honey (agave works well too). You could easily mix PB2 with PB to wean onto this gradually.<br /><br />TEXTURE: Mixes fast and is very smooth (surprisingly). From the jar, it's similar in consistency to powdered sugar. Open factory seal on jar carefully so it doesn't fly out (trust me).<br /><br />MIXING: Easily mixes using a small spoon or spatula in a gently sloping small bowl (I use a pinch bowl)<br /><br />USAGE: PB2 has recipes on their website (Bell Plantation) and they also sell a chocolate/pb product. I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best.

18028,B008ZRKZSM,A1Y82GMMVWQHIZ,Jersey Coffee Girl,24,25,5,1273622400,Really Good,"This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, ""clean"" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really ""go for it"" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping."

Am I an idiot? Maybe... Still, if you need 2Tbs of peanut butter you will use almost 4 Tbs. I have only used it once so did not get good measurements because there was lots of adding more water or powder and also I usually weigh ingredients and as another reviewer pointed out the weight and volume on the label didn't match. This of course affects the calories and if you are counting them this matters to you.<br />I read reviews about price and didn't think much of it- it didn't seem that bad for a jar of PB but in a recipe that used 1/2c of PB I used at least 1/3rd of the jar so yeah, kinda pricey...

The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe."

It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet.

I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.<br /><br />I brough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co-workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!"

The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.

I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me. I'm not sure I would eat this off of the spoon, but I will definitely use it in PB&J sandwiches, shakes and other recipes for peanut butter flavor.  I read somewhere that mixing it with Greek yogurt is very good as a protein-packed fruit dip."

Everyone has their own kind of shakes they make and for me, it's Slim-Fast + fat-free milk + 1 tbsp of PB2 + some ice in a blender. It is a great tasting chocolate peanut butter shake! I have not used the PB2 in other similar ways. I enjoy my shake so much though, that I will continue to buy the PB2 for it.<br /><br />That being said.. I mixed it to make it just like a peanut butter- 2 tbsp of powder + 1 tbsp of water. I spread it on an English muffin (I love an English muffin with peanut butter). Unlike other reviews, I have to say, that was not pleasant at all. The consistency was fine but I'd give up peanut butter altogether before doing that again. In my opinion, it was awful tasting and even made me sick to my stomach while I was eating it and for a while after I had finished.<br /><br />Even though I disliked the PB2 prepared with water, I still give it 4 stars because it is such a great mix-in and I will continue to make my chocolate peanut butter shakes with it. I will have to keep my natural Jif peanut butter though for sandwiches until there's a truly adequate/great tasting substitute. I've seen several dieticians and they have all said it's a good idea to fit in natural peanut butter into the diet for the healthy fats, but just don't overdo it. I've lost 20 lbs and still incorporated natural peanut butter into my diet, so it can be done (again, moderation).<br /><br />Nutrition: The nutrition is also why this product is so popular!

Great for veggie dips. AWESOME added in at the end of a stir fry, to give a great peanut flavor and to thicken your sauce. It is outstanding some fresh udon noodles, a little black bean soy sauce, some stir fried meat and veggies (stir fried in broth, not oil), then add it at the end to thicken the broth/soy for an excellently flavoured and low fat dinner."

The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB.

Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable ""peanut butter""-- Barely enough to coat half a slice of bread. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories--not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder.

Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as ""PB2"" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again)."

Unsaturated fats can help lower LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) levels in the blood without affecting the HDL cholesterol (""good"" cholesterol). Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and even depression.<br /><br />Just buy the natural kind and avoid the additives."

It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!<br /><br />One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.

(I think REAL peanut butter is about 190). I was amazed  and very pleasantly surprised with the authentic peanut butter taste and consistency. Two TB is plenty to make a sandwich or a topping for another food. I even had my husband try it, as he loves the extra chunky, fat-filled kind. His words....""not bad!"" He won't be eating it, but he doesn't need to watch his waistline anyway. For someone who does, it's a great substitute.  I just ordered a large bag!"

Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix.

18192,B008ZRKZSM,A2IIMX1CS0TIE9,Trist,2,2,5,1323302400,So Good why isn't it Bad???,"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!"

To put that into perspective, 3 Tbsp of normal peanut butter is ~ 280 calories. The 5 grams of protein in it is just a bonus. I put it in protein shakes with a lot of other ingredients [...], and the taste still shines through and really improves the overall taste of the shake.<br /><br />The only downside to it, if there is one, is that it is pretty expensive. Even if you buy the 12 pack at $70 with prime, that still works out to almost $0.40 per serving, which is pretty steep for peanut butter. However, if you are on a diet, this is a very calorically efficient way to get some solid flavor and a few grams of decent quality protein."

Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly ""good fat,"" but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a ""seasoning"" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!<br /><br />To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut-butter-consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.  This is especially great for any baking recipes that call for peanut butter b/c we all know how difficult it can be to make those cookies and other sweet things ""healthy."""

I learned about PB2 on a web page where I can log my calories, and exercise. I ordered my first pack direct from the factory, but then found it here on Amazon and get it faster than from the factory. PB2 is only 45 calories for the same 200 calories found in most peanut butter, and it is the same 2 tbsp serving. This is great just as a snack if you love peanut butter like I do. It comes in a powder, and you simply mix 2 Table spoons of powder with one Table spoon of water, stir until thick and enjoy how ever you want. Worth the money!"

White grape juice & apple juice are near-universal bases for juice-blends, as they're bland & cheap to produce. Reading about their high sugar content & relative lack of vitality/food value, especially in comparison with heart-nurturing purple grape juice/wines, I decided to try darker juices.<br /><br />Welch's Concord Grape Juice was nice; Juicy Juice was OK; generic juices were generally not bad, tho of course they might not actually be juice but re-confabulations of concentrates plus high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). I've noticed over the past few years that HFCS tends to make me feel draggy; more recently, high fructose corn syrup's been implicated in our nation's widespread obesity, no pun intended.  ""Great, thanks, now ya tell me""... at least I know now!<br /><br />Kedem Concord was available at my local warehouse store, price comparable with other juices, and a label check said it was made of Concord grapes, with some Concord grape concentrate, no HFCS. With one swallow, it was clear to me that this product was distinctly superior in flavor, texture, non-obtrusive sweetness and tartness, and bloomin' wholesomeness than any other grape juice I've ever had. It has body, a velvet touch to the tongue, and many more dimensions than just one jolt of flavor. It's a genuine food, not a slug of sugar & color & liquid as currently so many so-called juices are, like a pre-mixed kool-aid that needs refrigeration.<br /><br />I'm far from wealthy & rarely buy treats (yep, even with the obesity!), especially juice, since actual fruit's better for me: more complete, cheaper, etc.  I am regularly buying Kedem Concord grape juice though.  Balancing dollars & quality, after again running my own consumer comparisons with other purple+/or concord grape juices, Kedem's still got it far, far over the other drinks available to me. I truly wonder what on earth could account for such a vivid difference.<br /><br />I still hate spending the money- it's good when cut half-& half with cheap raspberry lime seltzer, good mixed with other fresh & store-bought juices, good in cereal instead of milk (OK, an acquired taste, but I don't drink milk well), great mixed with nutritional (nicer than brewer's) yeast.<br /><br />I do have to include a caveat, tho, as it's preserved with Potassium Metabisulfite, which some might have reactions to, esp. asthmatics like myself. Man, am I fortunate NOT to have experienced any reaction to the Kedem Concord Grape Juice that I like so much!<br /><br />Yep- I likes it! And I whole-heartedly recommend it!"

So when I saw this I thought it was an opportunity to try something better. Indeed its a lot better tea, does get strong nicely and I use skim milk. It tastes much better obviously than the Tetley in a box, its full bodied, but it did not have a refreshing taste.<br />The reason I say that is I was drinking some other Assam team from a store in Cleveland(Teavana) and that was very refreshing, full bodied. Likely it wasn't organic. Obviously the price at Teavana for a few oz. was a lot more per oz. than the Banaspaty tea, so it has that going for it.<br />The Twinings are pretty good, likely they have their own tea-estate, but my guess is the tea-estates vary in flavor.<br />But, hey, remember where I came from, Tetley's bags to Assam Banaspaty.

They are always delicious, and there are varieties for every type of chili lover out there. ""Turkey Ranchero"" is a good alternative for those trying to cut fat from their diet. It's 98% fat free because the turkey is very lean. The flavor profile is pleasing, with nice paprika notes, but I could have used more jalapeno and generally stronger pepper flavors. The extremely lean and thick nature of this particular chili is also responsible for a drawback. The chili is advertised as ""thick and hearty"" and it is definitely part of a satisfying meal, however the combination of extremely thick viscosity combined with the ultra-lean turkey makes for some predictable problems for cooking, namely, the tendency is for this to stick badly to the pan, especially if overheated (I recommend medium heat at the most.) It is of crucial importance to stir this chili almost continuously when cooking or your pan will have a challenging to clean black charred residue on the bottom of it. Greasing the pan is an option, but can defeat the purposes of using lean meat in the first place if not careful. Do not get impatient: cooking this product slightly slower pays big dividends in the taste and cleanup departments.<br /><br />I really like Staggs' ""Turkey Ranchero"" and recommend it without hesitation; it has an enormous amount of beans, a very generous amount of turkey, and pleasant (though relatively mild) seasonings that most people will like (though I like to add red pepper flakes to mine.) A serving (two per can) has 19 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber, which for the hearty flavors makes the 5 grams of fat seem a reasonable tradeoff for most diets. Like any processed foods (and especially canned soups) the sodium levels are high at 790 mg per serving, so people on a restricted sodium diet should stay away."

""Dogs will be dogs"" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're ""guilt-free""; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them ""junk food"", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit."

Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to ""earn"" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the ""girls"" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my ""grand-dog"" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a ""luxury"" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their ""treatie-time.""<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!"

Newman's Own Organic French Roast Coffee is fair-trade organic coffee.  That means the coffee farmers are compensated fairly and the coffee is certified organic, which is better for us and the earth.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />This is a dark roast coffee, but it doesn't taste overly dark.  It has no bitterness, which is great, and is fairly smooth.  It lacks the complexity in flavor that other coffees can have, but it still tastes good.  It's a nice cup of coffee, and even if you don't care for dark roast, you may find you like this one.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, and this is a great coffee to do so.  However, adding flavored creamers would also taste pretty good.  Sometimes I add ground cinnamon to the coffee grounds in the basket, so it brews into the coffee.  That yields a nice, mild cinnamon flavor to the coffee.<br /><br />AROMA:<br />The aroma coming from brewing this coffee is very tantalizing.  It is warm and almost has a sweet scent to it.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The bag folds up and has a couple of arms which fold around the sides to keep it closed.  It stays pretty fresh that way.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I find this to be one of my lesser favorites in the coffee world, but it is still a good one.

Don't use this salt in salads and similar dishes, since once it dissolves you will not notice much of a difference with other salts (there will be, it will just not be as pronounced).

When added to a pan to saute, it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt. Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely, so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal (which I don't like). Used as a garnish, it looks cool but again, it's way to salty and thick for me to eat. The flavor is a very clean, super salty taste- more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use.

I've never had this happen with Miracle Gro.  Miracle Gro makes a good mix, at a decent ratio, which is great for growing most standard houseplants and excellent for growing from seed.<br /><br />As for the gnats:  Fungus Gnats can be found anywhere there is rot.  Don't clean your sink for a week - see those bugs?  Same thing.  They eat rot.  They cannot live in dry soil.  THE BEST PREVENTION for fungus gnats is to water with either a drip-irrigation system (plastic tubing with holes in it, hidden beneath the soil surface) or water bottom-up (water the dish under the plant, and let the soil soak the water upwards).<br /><br />The fastest and most common way to become infested is to overwater your plants.  I did this one year - we had them everywhere, in all our food, on the walls, and it was disgusting.  If you already have an infestation, try lowering the frequency of your waterings - your plants won't get dehydrated from a little less if the gnats have been happy with what they've had.  Let the soil top dry completely before you water - gnats and their young live near the top, in damp soil.<br /><br />Yes, I've seen more gnats with this than other soils.  However, that could easily have been because the batch I had had been kept more damp in the store than the other stuff.  Water less, you'll have fewer gnats.  Get Scott's and be prepared to be disappointed (that's the brand I found the crushed tin-can pieces and gum in)."

I plunged my arm at least 25 inches down into the planters and the soil was hotter than beach sand, all the way down. This product somehow retains heat and was cooking my plants. When I removed this soil, I was surprised to find big pockets of it that were dust dry. The 2 planters in shade did a little better, but no plant growth whatsoever. Maybe if the plants grew in this from seed, they would do better, but you can't put plants in root balls into it - this soil just won't let the moisture leach into adjacent soils. And it cooks them.

Frank,3,3,5,1234224000,Reading the label makes ME hungry!,"So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too."

18523,B001SB8J0S,A209WZE5WJFA7L,"Jack London ""Buck""",2,2,5,1268179200,"As good as the best BBQ sauce, maybe it is the best","I grew up in the South and in seemed that in every county I lived in or tried BBQ in, there were raging controversies over which county and which BBQ restaurant had the best BBQ sauce.  There were mustard based sauces (South Carolina) that were not sweet, sauces sweetened with various ingredients, all types of sauce use this method except perhaps vinegar based. My father grew up in North Carolina so when we went to visit my grandmother in Goldsboro NC we ate the BBQ there with a hot vinegar based sauced which was quite good.<br /><br /> In short, I have tried just about every sauce out there including Mustard, Ketchup, Tomato, Vinegar and even Mayonnaise based BBQ sauce.  I would rate this as one of the best if not the best I've ever tasted.  The reason I don't rate it as number one is that I now live in the northeast and don't have access to many sauces that I used to, but this sauce is just astoundingly good and I've tasted maybe a hundred sauces in my lifetime, perhaps more than a hundred but probably less than 200.<br /><br />  I haven't had an opportunity to eat a Mayonnaise based sauce in years and as far as I know, no one is making a Mayonnaise based BBQ sauce but I would rank this sauce from what I remember Mayonnaise based tasted like, as in the top tier with the home made Mayonnaise based sauce that a man I know used to make,  but I haven't had that sauce in more than 25 years.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this sauce.  Incidentally, how did Mr. Larry come up with the name ""loose lipped""?  Does he talk a lot, gossip a lot, or is there some other secret behind the name that I'm missing?<br /><br />I have no affiliation with the company, have no interest in writing this comment other than I just love this sauce and I believe good things should be promoted.  And this sauce is more than good, it's exceptionally good, in the top tier with the best.  That's just my opinion though, try it for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.  The spice is slightly warm but not overpowering and if you're worried about it being too hot, you needn't worry.  This sauce is just slightly warm and that's one of its great benefits. Its sweet but not too sweet. It's got a combination of tomato and mustard and maybe some vinegar taste to it but I'm not sure about the vinegar.  It's just everything good about BBQ sauces rolled into one. And coming from me, you don't hear that kind of compliment very often.<br /><br />Even my wife likes it better than any other sauce4 I've brought home when coming back from trips down south. She eats it  on my famous home cooked pork tenderloins that  I cook quite often and that's saying a lot because she claims not to like garlic and I didn't let her in on the secret that garlic is one of the ingredients.  I only bought one bottle when I was down South and I'm sorry I let her try it because she finished off the bottle.<br /><br />I haven't tried the other sauce Mr. Larry makes but would like to give it a spin but for some reason  Amazon doesn't carry it."

The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.

Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too ""fishy"" smelling.  Just different.

I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.<br /><br />If you're ordering the box for yourself, by all means, go for it.

18586,B00545GNMU,A19RFHTBNX7YOP,Kamaroos,4,4,5,1325116800,My favorite coffee!!,"I have been a fan of Peet's coffee for nearly 30 years, starting from when I was a student at UC Berkeley. Peet's had a few cafe's in Berkeley, roasting their coffee on the premises. People standing in line always got a small cup of complimentary coffee, brewed super strong and served hot and black, not for the faint-of-heart. Major Dickason's blend has long been my favorite - strong, rich, smooth. When my brother moved to Seattle he was ecstatic that he had found a local cafe that was almost as good as Peet's. The name of the cafe was Starbuck's. Some years later Starbuck's and Peet's joined forces, but eventually Starbuck's expanded internationally and Peet's chose to stay local. Peet's wanted to keep its coffee pure (not mixed with syrups and whipped cream) and didn't want to compromise its quality by expanding too quickly. I am so thankful that Peet's chose to stay true to what excellent coffee is really about, and since I moved away from Berkeley I am thankful that logistics have improved, and I can get fresh Peet's shipped to me (even now that I am living overseas).<br /><br />While I could go on and on about Peet's, which I love passionately, it is not a coffee for everyone. It is much stronger and richer than most, and some people whom I have served it to have found it to be too strong (I guess I could have brewed it with less coffee grounds or mixed some hot water in at the end, but it didn't occur to me at the time). But if you really love coffee, and you want something much much much better than Starbuck's, then you might really like Peet's."

We used this blend to experiment with our new single-serve coffee maker, the Jura Ena Micro 1.  This is basically an espresso maker, but it can make several strengths, and besides espresso shots, it makes ristretto and lungo cups also. We found the Major Dickason's Blend to taste rich and full-flavored made as an intense shot and also as a milder 12 oz. regular cup of coffee. Can't get much better than that!  For a coffee to provide a great brew at many different strengths is a real plus.<br /><br />Be aware that this coffee is offered in both 12 and 16 ounce bags--and the bags look alike, so do your math before asssuming one bag is cheaper than another.  I'm so glad to see Peet's products offered here at Amazon.  Peet's products are always top-notch and very fresh.  Their coffee and tea buyers really know what they are doing."

Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday ""work horse,"" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee."

It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the ""fannings"" or ""dust"" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea.

The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the ""chicken flavor"" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended ""Golden Aloe"" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well.

I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack"", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online.

He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!"

He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY"">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats."

Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his ""golden years"" without the misery of a poorly aging dog.

Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.

My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you!

Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past."

It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM"">Celsius®, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG"">Celsius®, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product."
18761,B001534R00,A2KFT3KTW8N2UW,Carol,1,1,5,1344470400,Best morning drink,The carbonated version of the orange Celcius drink is the perfect drink for first thing in the morning.  It starts the day off on the right foot.  I have been drinking a half can of celcius each morning for a couple of years and as long as I can get it (Amazon is the very best place to buy) I will keep starting my day off with Celcius.
18762,B001534R00,A1EX896992AF4Q,Al from NYC,1,1,5,1329955200,"Replace the ""black cup of coffee""","I am in my mid 20s, approx height 5'8"". For a good part of my college years I was 220-250lbs, I have since dropped down to 175 (weight loss not related to this drink). I began a rigorous workout routine once I reached my ideal weight to eliminate the love handles. Working full time and attending Masters Degree classes part time, with a few hours a week spent at the gym, really takes a toll on the energy level. Preworkout I drink Jack3d with A-Akg powder. That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice bread. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, ""Sparkling Orange"". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This brought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick. Today is a perfect example, I worked a full shift on 8 hours of sleep, 8am-4pm, worked out at the gym from 9pm-11pm, slept 2 hours, and got up to go into work at 4am, pickup a few hours of overtime, drank a can and I am feeling GREAT. The energy boost is enlightening. So if you are looking for a good energy booster at a better price than most, this is it for you. I love Monster Absolute zero, but it is more than twice the price per can."
18763,B001534R00,A1UBHWCJYZ62T8,Corwin G. Lemon,1,1,5,1295222400,Weight Loss vs. Energy Drink,"If you are looking for a product that is going to help you lose weight, then perhaps look elsewhere. This drink has a lot of good ingredients in it, but like nearly everything out there on the market, it chiefly relies on thermogenics, with the main active of caffeine. Caffeine's effectiveness is affected by the fact that your body builds a tolerance to it, so as a weightloss ""program,"" the effectiveness of this product decreases over time (and you're only talking maybe 2 weeks here, depending on how often you take it).<br /><br />If, however, you are looking for an energy drink, I'd HIGHLY recommend Celsius. I started drinking this stuff a few years back before its distribution was up, and I've not been disappointed. It will definitely ramp you up, and because its very low sugar, you don't have the associated crash you get with drinks like Monster and Rockstar. Plus, the Ginger is a nice touch. I typically have big energy dips after meals, but it I drink one of these before or during a meal (like lunch), I don't experience the dip. My educated guess is that the ginger (which aids in digestion) is a big part of this, and it's an ingredient you don't find in other drinks.<br /><br />Tastes, vary from person to person, but I find Celsius's flavor strangely addictive. I drink the Wild Berry and the Sparkling Orange.<br /><br />Overall, this product gets my highest praises, and the shipping on it is lightning fast (like, 2 days to get to my door on regular shipping). Just know what you are putting into your body, and realize there is a fairly heavy dose of caffeine in this stuff (200 mg)."

I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking ""too much"" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my son tried one before his workout and got ""jittery"".

But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.

It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Amazon when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Amazon. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back, until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address, but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future, but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Amazon will not take back food items.<br /><br />As far as the oil, the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world. I plan to try them all out now, from the La Tourangelle website. Companies that go above and beyond will always get my business because they actually care about their product.

MACLEAN,83,84,5,1249257600,A flavorful alternative to extra virgin olive oil for high temperature cooking,"I bought Avocado Oil specifically for two reasons: one, because it is very similar to olive oil in texture and smell, yet brings a new flavor component to my cooking, and secondly and most importantly for me . . . it has a much higher smoke/burn point than extra virgin olive oil--even higher than Canola oil, grapeseed oil and yes, even safflower oil. I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick-fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.<br /><br />Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues. That's an especially nice thing, since I have a hyper-sensitive smoke detector and have little room for error when it comes to smoke. To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their brand for some other less well-known oils as well.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended--to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil."

Then I learned that when an oil smokes, it releases carcinogens into the air and free radicals within the oil.  Olive oil should NOT be heated beyond 325 degrees F.  So, in searching for an oil with a higher smoke point PLUS staying within a ""paleo"" eating way of life I discovered Avocado Oil.  This is my new holy grail of oils:  it's got a smoke point of 510 degrees F, tastes wonderful, is made from a healthy fat, looks gorgeous in a homemade vinaigrette due to its beautiful green color.<br /><br />This oil should be refrigerated when opened; the cans have an expiration date of 8/2011--they'll be long used up by then.  When my cans arrived, they had dented in a little bit--which I promptly got out by gently squeezing the cans (the metal is quite pliant).

In the past, quality oils have turned my mayo slightly greeninsh, this stuff turned it an odd bright yellow which does make me doubt the quality of the product."

Hope you folks haven't been cooking at a temperature beyond that, you could be eating bad oil. REFINED avocado oil is up to 520F, but this is NOT fully refined (which makes a better product in terms of retaining nutrients and flavors). The 350F is clearly stated on the manufacturer's website, and also their response to an email inquiry I sent.<br /><br />""The smoke point of REFINED Avocado oil is in fact the highest of any<br />vegetable oil at around 520. Our oil is not fully refined, and in so being<br />retains the wonderful flavor and aroma of Avocados. The smoke point for our<br />oil is as stated 350 because it has more avocado solids in it, that's why it<br />tastes so good. Fully refined oils are  odorized and less flavorful.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Thank you for your support of La Tourangelle.""<br /><br />That means there are a lot of retailers out there providing the wrong information on this. If you want a high smoke point, make sure it is REFINED avocado oil. For its purposes, this is still a great oil to use."

It is not at all bitter.  Avocado oil is pressed from the flesh of the avocado, not the seed.<br /><br />It is especially good drizzled on fresh-baked bread or pizza.  It is nice on a salad although if there are other strong flavors for it to compete with such as balsamic vinegar, onions, or cheese, consider using a less expensive oil with a more competitive flavor such as first-press olive oil and save this for when you can better appreciate its unique sensory qualities.  There is a recipe on the label for a citrus dressing with equal parts of this oil and citrus juice with a little honey, salt, and pepper which complements the flavor of the oil rather than overpowers it as a dressing with vinegar does.<br /><br />Avocado oil also has a medium-high smoke point, higher than that of olive oil, so it is safer to use for cooking on the stove top although there are less expensive oils just as suitable for this purpose.<br /><br />Avocado oil is also an excellent oil for use on the skin and the scent is pleasant enough that I will dab a little on my elbows and knuckles when using it in the kitchen.<br /><br />The oil is packaged in a can to protect it from light and the lid fits tightly, although I have found that it will drip from the spout and collect on top of the can.  Twisting the can at the end of the pour (as with a bottle of wine) helps prevent this.  It can be stored at a reasonable room temperature but it would be better off in the refrigerator in warm climates or instead of over the oven.<br /><br />I purchased my La Tourangelle Avocado Oil at a organic grocery store chain (known for high prices) because other customers have reported that they have received rancid cans from Amazon, probably from sitting in a hot warehouse.  Let's hope Amazon addresses this issue and also provides appropriate packaging to protect the attractive can during shipping as the price is significantly lower here."

It also means I'm avoiding packaged foods, such as mayonnaise, which is actually how I found avocado oil and what prompted me to purchase this product.  (This stuff makes FANTASTIC homemade mayo!  Buy it!  Try it!)<br /><br />I've never particularly liked the taste of extra virgin olive oil (it has a bitter taste to me) and it should not be used to cook at high temperatures as the smoke point is about 405 degrees F.  Avocado oil, on the other hand, has a subtle aroma and taste and a HIGH smoke point of about 520 degrees F, making it useable for pretty much anything.  I use it for salad dressings, marinades, and cooking (with the exception of deep frying - I don't deep fry anything).  With the exception of some specialty oils, such as walnut oil and truffle oil, this is the only oil I keep in the house anymore.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  When I purchased this through Amazon, both of the cans were dented.  Since I drain the oil into a tinted glass oil drizzler, that didn't bother me but FYI to those who might be.  I've found these at my local TJ Maxx many times and the cans have never been dented, so check there if you just want to give avocado oil a try or you need an unblemished can."

I sent an email to the manufacturer but did not receive a straight answer.  Their reply is that all their oils are pressed by expeller-presser at room temperature without using any chemicals.  I think I will try the other brands of avocado oil that are advertised ""organic and cold-pressed"" after I am done with this order."

I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than ""buttery"" olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it, though. I've used it for sauteing, on toast with onion or garlic powder, salads, rubbed some in my skin and a tiny bit on my chapped lips. I may get it again as I like to have a variety in my diet plus the avocado oil is good for moisturizing my skin.

The day I got this, I poured some in a small dish and tried using it as a dipping oil with bread.  I normally use olive oil and love it but love trying new things and was looking forward to this since others said the taste was great.  Well I personally did not like it all as a dipping oil.  I could not get past the first bite of bread and immediately dumped it and got the olive oil.  I've used it in saut&eacute;ing dishes and it is fine for that purpose.  I don't fry food at home so I've never used this other than in regular cooking.  THis is a decent oil if you are in the search for different products to try but I personally prefer olive oil for dipping and cooking and prefer walnut oil for salad dressings.

I used to think fried food was just fatty - now I know it's also toxic. That research led me to take note of the smoke points of the various oils I use when cooking and make sure I don't reach them. I try to only use healthy oils and use them properly:<br /><br />Coconut Oil - smoke point: 350-400 degrees F<br />Olive Oil - smoke point: 350-400 degrees F<br />Avocado Oil - smoke point: 520 degrees F<br /><br />The smoke point of most common oils is around 350-400 degrees F - depending on the specific type/process used to create the oil. As a result, it's pretty easy to reach those smoke points and create toxins in your food.<br /><br />Avocado oil has a very high smoke point (520 degrees F). It also has a fatty profile similar to olive oil (healthy in moderation). This makes it an ideal substitute to whatever you were using to cook things at high heat. For me this means any time I cook meat in my cast iron skillet (high heat to get a nice sear). The avocado flavor is very mild and is not something you will taste in the finished product.<br /><br />I've been using this product for a few months...<br /><br />EDIT: It just dawned on me that this product is in a can. While the oil itself has been great, I cannot continue buying anything in a can. I have been phasing canned items out of my kitchen to avoid BPA. Even BPA-free cans have to have some replacement chemical lining the aluminum to prevent corrosion. As such I am dropping this rating down to 4 stars and will look for other options.

And even though I'll use the occasional spray of canola on a pan, I prefer this to Canola or Olive Oil.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have a mild skin allergy to olive oil.

This year, I attended a giant party where I drank more than my body weight in booze THEN finished off a fifth of Jameson with 3 others...all in all, I drank for about 7 hours and was well on my way to a ""Never drinking again.."" kinda morning.  I managed one more shot (of Party Armor) before bed and woke up thinking ""Did I even drink last night?"".  Seriously, aside from a slight headache which I quickly got rid of with some excedrid, I felt amazing on New Year's day.  Dont drink and drive, but also dont drink without Party Armor.  (As a side note, they might not advertise this, but it gets rid of hangovers if you already have one, just drink it quickly and try your best to keep it down.) Awesome, awesome, product."

With slight trepidation, I pried the bottle cap off of this evil beverage and took a sniff --""Okay,"" I foolishly thought to myself, ""it smells a little bit strange, but not as bad as I expected."" (I was in denial)!  Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, ""rot gut"" began to settle in, and any lingering ""open mindedness"" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again."

Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar -- OR-- sweeten it to bring out even more of its wonderful flavor -- AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk-- your Earl Grey will take on a ""Chai presence""!!! Either way, Twinings Earl Grey is a tea to look forward to time and time again.<br /><br />Lady Grey was new to me, and yes it is a bit lighter and not as intense as the Earl himself, but Lady Grey is still very very good -- notably so.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast is a tea that may make you break out in song -- it is robust and delightful, clearing up ""morning fog"" in a hearty way.<br /><br />This is a very good variety pack, IMHO, to keep on hand at the office when having panel meetings or board meetings -- or just in the ""break kitchen"" for folks to enjoy when they are want a tea break!!

Blankenship,2,2,5,1330646400,NICE VARIETY AND A RELATIVE INEXPENSIVE WAY TO FIND OUT IF YOU LIKE FOUR VARIOUS BLENDS,"When I write a review on teas I am always hesitant to either fully recommend any given tea, or conversely, to recommend that it not be touched with a ten foot pole and that it is not fit for human consumption.  The reason for this is taste.  We are all different in this area and what may be an absolute delight for me, may quite well be another's gastronomical bane. Finding the ""just right tea;"" the tea that is the beginning and the end for the lover of tea is an adventure and in my opinion, an adventure that should last a life time.  I started drinking tea (we are talking hot tea here) as a small child, as did my wife, and we have been together on our search for well over 50 years now.  I have to tell you that the trip has been wonderful!<br /><br />Now a person can sink a lot of money into their tea habit and hobby over the years.  Nothing is worse (well, I suppose many things are indeed worse...I just use this as an expression) than to spend a King's Ransom on a large amount of new tea(s) that you want to try and find that you find you cannot stand the stuff!  We have found in recent years a bit of a solution to this problem in these ""variety packs"" offered by many companies - Twinings being the leader in this marketing method.  We get to sample different varieties and blends, in this case four separate blends, without having to sell our first born into bondage to be able to afford it.  The other upside to this variety pack, as with many like packs, is that you get several tea bags of the same blend so that you have plenty to make your mind up with.  We never try just one cup or one brew as taste can change from day to day as well as moods; and trust me, when it comes to tea drinking, moods and attitude do count!<br /><br />With this variety pack you get a nice sampling of English breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey and Irish breakfast teas to sample.  All of these teas are of the black variety; all are different and all have a nice full-bodied presents which is ideal if dark full-bodied teas are ""your thing.""<br /><br />Even this pack though will show the difference in taste.  I am fond of the English breakfast tea (My favorite if this selection), where as my wife favors the Lady Grey.<br /><br />This is a good selection to simply get to know four nice blends.  If you brew it correctly, use good quality water and let yourself relax and be as objective as possible, I should think you will be pretty happy with it...or maybe not.  I personally liked it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"

Short of that, I can't imagine anything I'd complain about with this mix.<br /><br />English Breakfast: Strong, dark, and goes well with a dash of milk if that's your thing. A solid way to wake up, any day.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast: It's hard to say this blend tastes lighter than the English, but it makes you feel lighter. Great with a full Irish breakfast, the Irish blend really makes you happy to meet the day.<br /><br />Earl Grey: Twinings brand actually bears the seal of the (or, an) Earl of Grey, and it is probably the best Earl you can get from a bag. Great for any occasion, especially for Star Trek nerds like me who can't help but chuckle and mumble ""Earl Grey- hot"" with every mug.<br /><br />Lady Grey: A remarkable inclusion, Lady Grey is based on the Earl flavor. Whereas the Earl tastes of deep orange, the Lady has a very light dash of lemon. Lady Grey is an excellent and complex treat, good for relaxing or just plain enjoying your tea. Lady Grey is light and aromatic, without being a gimmick tea like so many other brands are willing to push. This is a serious tea, and yet it still has a sense of fun.<br /><br />This mix has it all. You've got your strong standby flavors that are great in the morning (English and Irish), you've got a great anytime flavor (the Earl), and a superb treat flavor (the Lady). Short of making the jump to looseleaf tea, you just can't find better flavors than this."
18868,B000F4H5FY,A1F7YU6O5RU432,Angela Streiff,4,5,5,1312329600,A collection for those who enjoy black teas.,"I enjoy black tea blends over any other. I don't drink coffee, so black teas takes the place of it. Many variety packs have a selection of herbals, blacks and green teas. Thankfully Twinings offers us this variety pack of wonderful black teas.<br /><br />The Teas:<br /><br />Irish Breakfast:<br />I love this blend. I have always been a fan of Irish Breakfast. If your new to the tea, don't let the name and green packaging give you the impression there's anything minty about it. It's a straight black tea (typically 100% Assam teas). No sweetness or flavoring of any kind. This is typically taken with sweetener or has milk added to it to taste (like straight black coffee). I personally enjoy it without anything added, and drink it black. Because of it's caffeine content, I prefer drinking Irish Breakfast in the mornings. It also goes great with meals since there are no strong flavors/aromas to overpower the taste of ones food.<br /><br />English Breakfast:<br />Much like the Irish Breakfast tea, it is also a blend of black teas without flavors added. However, there are usually several black teas blended together (most common Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan) to produce the flavor of English Breakfast. The information of the exact leaves blended is not offered as information from Twinings, saying only that it is a blend of black teas, but those are the usually ones. While not as bold as the Irish Breakfast, it is still a strong tea that is typically accompanied by milk or sugar.<br /><br />Lady Grey:<br />A milder version of Earl grey, very subtle citrus flavors have been added to this blend. By no means is this a fruity tea, as it is just a tiny hint of flavor. Not nearly as aromatic as the Earl Grey blend, this Lady Grey has a much more delicate taste.<br /><br />Earl Grey:<br />Bold, aromatic and memorable. Most tea drinkers can pick out a cup of Earl Grey no matter the brand, and Twinings blend is no different. An unmistakable presence of Bergamot can be found, but is not so strong to be off-putting. Fans of Earl Grey will find this a medium strength blend, just enough to know what your drinking, but not the strongest on the market. A nice tea for afternoons and evenings."

Since I only drank tea at restaurants and my Mom's at obligatory dinners, no big deal.  Well as I slipped towards 50 I began to drink more coffee (which I liked) but which eventually led to a parting of ways due to the fact that the coffees I liked, did not return the favor and feeling slightly nauseous was not the desired effect I was looking to achieve.  One day a friend of mine suggested I try some quality tea (which meant nothing made by Tetley/Liptons/etc).  I tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN2F"">Tazo Passion Tea, 24 Tea Bags</a> and while good it was missing that elusive element combination of good taste and adequate energy boost.  So I stumbled into this item <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FY"">Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which gave me 4 choices (great idea).  So without any additional ramblings are my opinions:  English Breakfast Tea = 5 Star, this stuff is great  /  Irish Breakfast Tea = Again 5 Stars, maybe a infinitesimal edge over the English version / Earl Grey = 4 Stars, good taste and flavor, not as good as the breakfast teas (IMHO) but probably better for later in the evening  / Lady Grey = WTF??  This stuff was horrible, I tried to use 1 bag of it with 2 bags of the others to keep from pitching it into the trash but to no avail, I am gonna give it to someone who has no taste buds.  1 Star.<br /><br />Again, realize I am far from a connoisseur of fine tea but I know what I like and what I don't, I am going to buy a few boxes of the breakfast teas and enjoy them.  BTW I also bought a huge box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE"">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a> and to prove my tastes are obviously out of the norm I hated it (I wanted to love it but alas it has something added to it that sure ain't tea)"

Since it got too complex hereabouts, I just order tea bags these days instead of a good old-fashioned brew-up with my favorite antique English teapot.<br /><br />It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey and Lady Grey. For you ignorant slobs, Irish breakfast is the finest, blackest and strongest tea you can get. English is a bit dialed back but it is just as hearty. These beg for cream and sugar, but it is no sin to have it black. The Greys are meant to be taken with lemon and you'll suffer if you try to pour cream or milk into either of them!<br /><br />So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box, from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that.

Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings good cheer, the genuine cup that cheers."

But I made a lovely discovery: the Lady Grey. I wrote a review about it saying how it quickly became my favorite comfort tea. As for the Earl Grey, it's passable when I'm out of Lady Grey, but only if I steep it for a few short seconds - otherwise it's too strong.<br /><br />Whatever is the case, here you have the chance to try 4 flavors and find your favorite.

It's still more gingery than your standard ginger ale (or Zevia ginger ale, which is quite bland by comparison,) but for a ginger lover like me it's a disappointment. If I had never tasted the more gingery version, I'd probably tell you this is damn fine ginger ale, but the ""Jamaican Ginger Ale"" moniker is now a bit overblown.<br /><br />Hopefully they just made a weak batch and the next case will be back to gently burning the mouths and tummies of thirsty travelers worldwide."

Firstly, I felt I was drinking water that had been poured into a glass that used to have Pepto Bismol in it, but had not been rinsed out first. Secondly, I thought maybe it tasted more like truvia had been simply mixed with water into a sickening solution.

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

The canisters are very nice, though rather wasteful if you don't reuse them. Fortunately they are very useful. I keep some in a hardware drawer for nails, tacks, etc. I keep a dozen in a drawer next to the stove for loose herbs from my garden or spices bought bulk. The containers keep a good seal for freshness, yet are easy to open. I label the tops and keep a ""disposable"" plastic spoon inside each for measuring.

I had found and tried this Twinings Gunpowder Green (loose) tea at a local Fresh Market.  I enjoyed it, but getting to that store (and their having it in stock) was troublesome.  I was very happy to see the same tea on Amazon for a bit over a dollar LESS (per tin) than my local cost (not including my travel time or tolls paid).  The tea has a very nice flavor (FAR better than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QPU"">Stash Premium Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> which was the other green tea I'd found locally).  It also has a good color and aroma.  One of the things I like about gunpowder tea is that it's easy to portion out.  I scoop out 1 level teaspoon of tea and use it for two full serving in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a>.  The tea leaves are of sufficient quality that there are almost no fragments, so nothing gets through the infuser but the flavor.  If I were a tea purist, I'd probably have some issue with the fact that the gunpowder rolls of leaves are not as tight as they should be and the spent leaves look like they're somewhat irregular.  But, considering that this tea is many times less expensive than the high quality stuff from the specialty shops, I'm very happy with it.  The one thing I'm just a touch worried about is storage.  The six tins in this package will last me many months.  Since each tin is opaque and is sealed with an aluminum film, I figured the best location for storing the tea until I moved it to my ""in-use"" spot would be the refrigerator.  The tin and the film should keep light and moisture out and the temperature fluctuations should be minimal.  But, I still worry a bit.  Still, I'm very pleased with the tea and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."

It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product.

Granted its organic and cream colored although it is not creamed honey. It is ""pure"" honey in the truest definition. The texture is solid, dense, somewhat waxy and velvety smooth with a pleasant floral taste. It describes itself as a gel, but I think it is much denser and although one gets a 1# jar, it is a small weighty jar. It softens easily on a piece of warm toast which is heavenly (no butter needed) or simply enjoy eating a spoonful by letting it melt in your mouth for a sensual treat. Due to its cost, which I think it is worth every cent, I won't be using it in tea. I'll continue using Rain Forest organic honey also sold on Amazon for that purpose. I think of this American/Canadian made honey as a true health food as it has numerous benefits. If you ever purchased the creamed South of France honey in the pail that Amazon used to carry, this honey's flavor and texture(when softened)will remind you of that incredible French honey. This is now my favorite honey. I encourage you to visit YS Organic Bee Farms website for additional information as they are a remarkable company. Also to comment on Swanson, the company that sold it, they were quick to fulfill and ship the order, both jars were well packed, they thanked me for my order a couple of times and sent a coupon for $5 off a future order which can be used in a direct order w/ them or on Amazon.

And I have tried a LOT...,"I have been buying this Honey for 5 years, since I first was lucky enough to find it in an Organic Grocery Store. I have tried every kind of organic/raw honey brand out there, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and this is by far the best flavor and the best price. Like the other review, I also think of this more as a ""cream"" consistency than as a ""gel"", and it is just heavenly that way. It melts down easy on warm bread or in warm tea, and it is just jam packed with all the flavor and health benefits that have been stripped from all of the runny honey that are filtered inferiors (that are clear in color because of it)that are found at big grocery store chains. If you are lucky enough to find a raw unfiltered honey at a place like that, expect to pay a small forture for it. Go to your local Organic Grocery and you will find a great selection of good honey for a good price, but be prepared, only Y.S Organic Raw Honey is the best and unfortunately it is not commonly found locally, as I have moved several times and have discovered for myself. Amazon has the best prices and the biggest jar sizes I have ever found of this amazing honey, so this is the ONLY place I buy!!! They also have a 22oz size, but sadly it comes in a plastic jar instead of glass, which is just sad since anything stored long term in plastic can ""leech"" chemicals from the plastic into your foods...so I only buy the largest they offer in glass (16oz). If you are debating about trying an Organic/Raw honey, or switching to a new brand, LOOK NO FURTHER. This is one purchase you will NOT regret and you will be a customer for life!!!!"

After moving here to Arizona, I've been able to completely take myself off of all medications.  More recently however, my father passed away and apparently my emotional reaction triggered one of the worst asthma attacks I've had in years.  For the past two weeks, I've been gasping for air even after walking a short distance and could not even say a few words to people without gasping for air and panting.  My asthma became so bad this time that I contemplated going to the emergency room because I felt like I was going to pass out.  Instead what I did was do breathing exercises, bio-feedback, meditation and prayer.  While in the health food store I came across this tea, purchased it and staggered home to prepare it.  After drinking some, I noticed a little difference in breathing after about 30 minutes.  But I was thinking that it may not be the tea but simply because I sat down and relaxed for a while.  After drinking 3 or 4 cups of this tea a day using two tea bags, I honestly did not notice any significant difference in breathing.  The only thing significantly different was the fact that I started coughing up more flim, but that just could be that the asthma attack was running its course or the fact that I was drinking more fluids.<br /><br />The tea definately tastes good.  It has slight mint flavor which cools your mouth when the air is drawn in.  There is also a slight sweet and pleasant bitter taste to it.<br /><br />I quickly finished up two boxes of this tea.  I may buy some more later because I really like the taste.  As far as it treating asthma and other respiratory problems, it was simply hard to tell.  IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK, THIS TEA WILL NOT RESTORE FREE BREATHING.<br /><br />Only a few days ago, my asthma has been dramatically clearing up.  I worked out yesterday and am able to do strenuous exercise without panting and wheezing like I was doing last week.  I very seriously doubt that the tea had a delayed effect.  Last week, I didn't want to do it but I staggered into a drug store and purchased an inhaler (I hate using those things because they contain epinephrine).  I had two choices, either I keep suffering and kill myself or restore my breathing."

I doubt I could tell the difference in taste OR texture between these and regular candy jelly beans. I recommend drinking water while consuming these beans. If you eat two or three without water you may notice (like I did) the beans settle a bit heavy. The water really facilitates the electrolyte/carbo distribution throughout the bloodstream.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you have an aversion to sports drinks for any reason, these sport beans offer an excellent source of electrolytes and some carbs.

Secondly that it works much much faster.  Before I'd put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results.  NOT SO WITH THE HOT SHOT!!  Put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reduced.<br /><br />This clear gel is much thicker than the Combat product.  A small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will need.<br /><br />The only downside to this product that I've come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses.  A couple of times I've pushed so hard to get it started, that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once (made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel).  In the future I'm going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each use.<br /><br />Another nice advantage is that the gel is clear.  The other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch, an amber color.  At times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner.

Tea has been and always will be an expensive commodity, and with good reason; its irresistible flavor depends on volatile compounds either inherent in the tea or added to enhance its finished flavor. The operative word here is ""volatile"" which is synonymous with ""fleeting"" and in the world of tea quality, packaging is everything. With Twinings tea you are getting a tea with the maximum protection; a foil-sealed metal can, for goodness sake.  Twinings delivers it to you with the understanding that you will enjoy the flavor that they meant for you to have so that you may return to them as a source of quality teas again and again.  Of course, once you've opened the can it's up to you to keep the can closed after use until the tea is all gone. I prefer loose tea and Twinings is my supplier of choice.  Twinings has so many varieties for you to choose from, there really is no reason to go elsewhere.

If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.

This is my first time I've taken time to review a product<br />and I felt like I HAD to, after such a bad review.  ALL of the Blue Sky Free products are<br />very tasty (as far as diet drinks go).  I drank diet drinks for years and gave them up<br />when I found out how toxic the artificial sweeteners were.<br /><br />I kept wondering why someone didn't come out with a diet soda made with Stevia (since<br />it's totally natural and healthy).  Finally, a few makers did.  I've tried several and<br />Blue Sky Free tastes the best to me.<br /><br />It is expensive and hardly ever goes on sale--but when it does, I grab all I can!"
19087,B003SBRUC4,A2H541DX8PJ33H,Ejflex,7,9,5,1303948800,Clowns who down rate this clearly miss the point...,First of all I happen to think this is delicious. It has no diet after taste as with most artificially sweetened sodas. Anyway the people who downward this are missing the point that this is NOT using poison to sweeten it. Stevia is natural. I have extremely sensitive taste buds and a sophisticated pallet and I can tell you that there's not much of a difference in flavor between say Sucralose(which is awful for you) and Stevia which is 100% safe.<br />So if u want to trash this and keep feeding you and your kids garbage and poison by all means. Google what artificial sweeteners do to the immune system. I used to be good for three colds per year and two sinus infections per year. Since eliminating all artificial sweeteners(from drinks gums candies etc they sneak it in everything now. Start reading labels) I have not been sick ONCE in 4 Yeats since eliminating it. So I'll stick to Blue sky when I choose to have a soda. It's delicious.

The aftertaste they are complaining about with this soda is the complex Birch oil aftertaste (in any real old recipe). I used to live in Quarryville, Pennsylvania and my neighbor showed me and my family how to make Birch brew with the cleaned roots, and the aftertaste is the same here. We live in a society with everything watered down to the point it all tastes like nothing with sugar added.  This is the best commercial root beer I have tasted sugar or not."

However, I do really enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBW50G"">Blue Sky Organic New Century Cola</a> and was curious to try a sugar-free version.  Ultimately, I decided to go with the root beer 'free' soda over a cola because I figured the stronger taste would better cover any strange stevia taste or aftertaste.  I don't buy or consume stevia in other products so I'm not really sure how it tastes on its own, but it's really not bad in this soda.  It also doesn't dry out your mouth like other sweeteners.  This soda definitely has a unique taste but, as another reviewer pointed out, I think you are mostly tasting the ""french sweet birch oil"" per the ingredient list.  It also lists tahitian vanilla, hence the 'creamy' aspect.  The ingredients are quality and while it still has zero nutritional value, it's a better bet over regular or other diet sodas by a long shot.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the misleading description: yes the soda does contain stevia as a sweetener but it is the second to last ingredient on the list.  The second ingredient out of seven is erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol, and NOT how this product is advertised to be sweetened.  Via wikipedia, it is ""60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost non-caloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is absorbed by the body, therefore unlikely to cause gastric side effects unlike other sugar alcohols.""  However, I bought this product because I wanted a natural (Stevia leaf) sweetened product rather than another lab-generated chemical.  Disappointed.  I'll probably continue to drink them over time, but will not be reordering.  The stevia content is minimal at best, with the main ingredients being filtered water and erythritol.  I'd rather consume 100 more calories and drink the natural and organic regular Blue Sky cola or root beer.<br /><br />You ARE still consuming an artificially-sweetened-with-chemicals drink!  If you're okay with that, the taste is nice.  But if, like me, that is exactly what you are trying to avoid, this product is not it."

I love having these sodium/msg-packed instant noodles every once in awhile when I'm too lazy to make lunch or dinner. I don't know if you'd actually call these ""seafood"" flavored, though there are little dried fish cakes and plenty of seaweed in them, but they are somehow indescribably good. I actually like the original flavor better, but since these were cheaper, I went with it.<br /><br />I've seen these with cheaper prices at asian supermarkets when it's on sale, but if you ""subscribe"" to this on amazon, it's worth an extra dollar or two not to make a trip to the market. When I cook these, I usually add an egg, some veggies, and leftover meat (or whatever is in the fridge). The seafood flavor packet is strong so it adds lots of flavor to everything else.<br /><br />When I got these delivered, none of my ramen were crushed, so it really depends on how carefully your delivery company treats the boxes.

Yes, have to agree it is seafood but a blended taste.  The dried seaweed / dried little fish disks ( like those imitation crab legs made of ground fish sticks )gives it more appeal.<br /><br />Delivery - I write this because you'll get noodle that are crushed on both sides.  I cringe at the thought of the other box I haven't opened yet.  Basically, your product condition is your selling point.  The problem is somehow in delivery or I suspect before boxing, the noodles are crushed so you end up something along the lines of a pill capsule shape.

It tastes great but olive oil is not something that it tastes the same since it is a natural product and final product taste depends to the season and origin which olives are produced from. Pomperian is an old name that has changed many hands during 100 years of its business history. It is a brand with reputation in Baltimore. I purchased a bottle of their olive oil produced in Chilli that was lighter color but it tasted so great that seemed like I was having olives straight from the tree and amazingly I paid only $6.49. I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil from a reputable seller but as I said it is not organic. Only EXTRA VIRGIN, the first round of olives that have been pressed have the 200 antioxidants, not refined or mixed with other oils.

You know it's going to be good. I keep a coffee grinder on my kitchen counter. Personally I like to grind the seeds and add them to whey protein smoothies with chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla spice flavors. Toasted flax pairs very well with those flavors. Also delicious in yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey or maple syrup. I also love to mix together 2 Tbsp of ground seeds, 1 tsp of coconut sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cardamom and ginger to sprinkle on top of a bowl of creamy porridge. It makes a great nutty topping for cereals. Can be added to baked goods as well.<br /><br />I love this product! Not only does it taste phenomenal, but I also feel good about the nutritional punch of Omega-3, lignans, and fiber. Scientific research points to flax having a balancing effect on hormones and breast health.<br /><br />When I recently ran out of this TJ product, I tried another product to COMPARE quality, Spectrum's Organic Dry Roasted Premium Flaxseed, and was very disappointed -- twice. Just today (5/9/2012), I opened yet another bag of Spectrum (2nd try), and again the product not only smells rancid, but tastes inferior. Expiration date on the bag is 8/9/2013. Spectrum also adds salt to improve the taste. Salt does not help the Spectrum product, and I won't be trying it again.<br /><br />If you're going to try whole *roasted* flax seeds for the first time, then you should try this Trader Joe product first. The taste and aroma won't disappoint, and there is no added salt. TJ's is just pure whole, roasted flax seed. Pure nutty yummy goodness.

Roach ""bookivore""",1,1,5,1311984000,An excellent fiber-rich gluten free flour blend,"This blended flour is wonderful for those on a GF diet and works well in baked goods, giving a richness without excessive coconut flavor. To determine if this product is right for you, it is important to consider how you plan to use it.  If you are looking to add a little fiber to smoothies or sauces or soups, you may want 100% coconut flour. If you are wanting it for flavorful baked goods recipes with fiber, this should work perfectly! If you are making your own flour blend and wanting a flour that will not effect blood sugar so much, this is not what you need.<br /><br />If you read the reviews elsewhere on Amazon for pure 100% coconut flours--which this product is not--you will find some users were expecting the benefits of coconut flour with the ease of all-purpose wheat flour. There are good reasons for blending other flours with coconut flour:coconut flour alone can be difficult and expensive to use because it requires a lot of liquid--usually in the form of eggs and oils--to make a recipe work properly. This product ""Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Coconut Blend Flour"" has solved some of that problem by blending in other flours.  If you are trying to avoid carbs, this likely is not the flour for you. HOWEVER, if like me you are trying to avoid gluten while also adding fiber in your diet, this may be exactly what you seek. Note again, this is a blend of several flours, so if you did not catch the word ""blend"" in the description above as some reviewers did not, take note. Each of the flours in the blend brings something to the table, but if you seek the benefits of 100% coconut flour, look elsewhere on Amazon--but before purchasing it do read the reviews from people who expected it to work like all-purpose flour in their baking. (Most of the poor reviews for both products are not the fault of the product but of the purchasers.)"

After steeping the tea for a minute or so, I took my first taste and OH MY! It tasted nothing like any tea I have EVER had. No bitterness, after taste, or anything, just a very flavorful cup of tea. The citrus/orange flavor from the bergamot oil is extremely flavorful and aromatic, and again NOT the least bit bitter or harsh.<br /><br />If this is how tea is suppose to taste, I've been missing out for years and years and I am glad to say that I am not hooked on loose leaf teas. Move over coffee, I now have a new favorite warm beverage!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Extremely flavorful.<br />No bitter/harsh taste.<br />Organic (if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br />A fair trade product (again if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price, though compared to other loose leaf teas it's a pretty good price..."

Last year a friend gave me a can of Rishi Earl Grey for Christmas. Wow. The flavor is everything other commenters have described.

Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.<br /><br />To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth-feel.  I highly recommend this tea."

One note: Upon first sniff of the tea leaves, the citrus note is STRONG, but it's more balanced in the flavor of the tea.<br /><br />The packaging is nice and keeps the tea fresh.<br /><br />The size of the tea leaves is adequate. I don't end up with a lot of ""tea dust"" at the bottom of my cup. This ""tea dust"" does increase as you use the tea and get farther down in the tin (I assume this is because the smaller pieces naturally tend to settle toward the bottom of the packaging in shipment).<br /><br />Overall, a nice blend!

I don't know if it's a different strain of bergamot, if it's processed differently, but the nose is almost tangerine-like in its brightness.<br /><br />The nose translates well to the flavor, though the bergamot difference is less obvious here.

While I have had many loose teas that come in tins, I do appreciate that under the outer cap, this tin has an additional metal stopper that is very easily removed but also prevents an explosion of tea leaves.<br /><br />The stopper not only serves as a seal, it is also useful in measuring the tea for brewing- this little inner stopper holds approximately 1 Tablespoon of tea (not packed, fairly loose...I measured it as I was curious...) which is the recommended amount for 8oz of water and proper brewing... Many folks do not like tea because they have not had properly brewed tea, so this is an impressive extra measure to ensure the brew is as intended...<br /><br />When you open the container the bergamot hits you in the face...I was hoping the overwhelming bergamot would settle down during the brew, but I still found that it was overwhelming to the point of being excessively perfumey (for me it was like being trapped in a small space with someone who bathed in a bottle of eau de anything)... It was quite drinkable when I attempted to get past the bergamot slap, and the Yunnan black tea was smooth and rich and delightful...Not bitter in the least, and very flavorful and tasty... Unfortunately, I could not get past the overwhelming bergamot... But I plan on trying some of Rishi Tea's other varieties as I do like this varietal of Yunnan black tea...<br /><br />I do also appreciate that this is USDA organic, Fair Trade certified and the tin tells the story of the tea and the people who cultivate it...<br /><br />I prefer my Earl Grey to be more balanced, with the tea aspect or the bergamot in harmony...."

As a result you can easily get 2 full steeping from these leaves.<br /><br />The tea has a nice balanced flavor, the bergamot isn't overpowering and it compliments the sweetness of the Yunnan tea.

The aroma of the bergamot is strong yet light with a apple, citrus blend that feels like it would be good in any season of the year.  The Earl Grey tea when brewed is quite nice with good strong flavor and the aroma of the bergamot remains for us to enjoy a little longer.

Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont.

Forget those mostly corn syrup and ""mint flavored"" concoctions and opt for this traditional English condiment. As I said it is tangy and sweet all-in-one. Mostly because it is just mint leaves ground into a delicious paste and some vinegar and sugar added for just the right combination of flavor.

19257,B001H0FHXW,A1RC907ZMN1A6N,Marcella Twain,5,5,5,1286150400,"Stronger than the Americano capsules, slightly bitter","The Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo capsules are awesome. This is a strong coffee, a caffe lungo is a ""long coffee"" or big coffee that Europeans drink. It's like their everyday coffee. The caffe lungo is meant to be a stronger tasting, somewhat bitter coffee. It means business. So if you like a strong, slightly bitter coffee in the morning like I do, it's wonderful. Now. Because the Dolce Gusto machine lets YOU decide how much water to add, you can further control the strength and therefore bitterness. Obviously, the more water you add, the more mild the coffee will be. I suggest that when you first get the machine, you experiment with strength by using a pyrex measuring cup. They suggest adding 4oz of water, but obviously you can add however much or however little water your heart desires to suit your tastes. Apparently, Europeans are not sitting around enjoying big mugs like Americans are. I think they simply drink more cups throughout the day.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a wonderful, full-bodied and slightly bitter coffee. I makes a wonderful crema layer. (the froth you get from a pressure-brewed coffee) You certainly can't get this from a k-cup or Keurig (drip brew) system. I love this first thing in the morning when I need a sock in the eye to wake me up!"

However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the ""Americano"" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy ""Americano"" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.

I use regular full roasts and I prefer the Baronet Izzy medium roast and also like the Baronet French Vannila pods. (more of a 'chick' blend)  But do not let that fool you.  If you want a bold coffee the dark or bold Baronet brands that our younger friends prefer are 'truck driver' approved.  We keep them on hand for guests so buy the variety pack or a simple Dark Roast.<br /><br />These pods will work in your Senseo however if you buy the pods in the foil packs that come in the box (stay fresher) they are larger and you may need to use the 2 pod holder with a single pod if you have the black machine.  However, one pod will 'mash' down ok in the one pod holder of the Supreme Senseo machine.  Yes, that wonderfull foam froth is still there.

No need to preheat an oven to 400 and bake 5 to 10 minutes or so. And here's another Tip:  use a non-stick pan, and you won't have to add olive oil. Just defrost first at room temp (only 30 minutes or less), then pan-fry less than a minute each side and you're ready to eat. It's hotter than you'll get at any restaurant.<br /><br />If you don't want to pan fry or waste a lot of energy preheating your oven to 400 then baking 10 minutes, here's another way my Mom discovered. Just pop the Naan right from the freezer into a high quality toaster (she has a DeLonghi). It's very quick, and tastes great.

While the broth preparation is by far the most important, you simply can't toss in any kind of rice noodle and hope it will turn out ok.  Admittedly, I was a little worried about these noodles when ordering; the branding on the outside seems to cater directly to westerners, so I had fears that it would be an ""Americanized"", and thus flawed take on rice noodles.  Luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />These are pretty good noodles; they are not that fragile, so you don't need to worry about them breaking apart during preparation or boiling.  Thai Kitchen is an American owned brand, manufactured in China, but it is apparent (and important) that they have a higher standard for quality as I've struggled to find a single broken noodle strand in the boxes I've opened.  Some of the cheaper quality 'mystery brand' chantaboon rice stick noodles I've used in the past have broken when looked at incorrectly.  These noodles are a little bit thicker @ 3mm wide, but a little on the short side @ around 12"" in length.  They take flavors very well and are appropriate for many types of dishes; perfect for stir fry, as the packaging indicates.<br /><br />The only reason I am knocking a star off of these is due to the aforementioned shorter length and because they are a bit starchy, requiring some rinsing (lest you intend to thicken/cloud your sauces and broths).<br /><br />If you have no real asian markets (international isle at Vons doesn't count) near you, these are the ones to get.  If you do have an asian market near you, try a few other brands as well as this one.  You may find that you prefer these.  If you're wondering why someone with a very American name as mine is speaking about these with any kind of authority, it's because I'm asian-american and grew up with no shortage of fantastic, authentic asian cooking at restaurants and at home.

He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as ""illegal"" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that ""coca leaf"" is a schedule II substance and illegal.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com."

In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The ""green"" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a ""resealable freshness bag,"" though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I love to cook cajun style food and will make my own from scratch when I have the time.  Reality means I usually focus on cooking the main course and will use boxed shortcuts for side dishes.  Zatarain's really shine in this role.  You give up surprisingly little for a ready mix product.  The flavors are within shouting distance of the real deal.  Compared to most foods made from a mix that require less than 2 minutes of your attention - it's practically a miracle.<br /><br />The Jambalaya and the Black Beans & Rice are the best flavors.  The Jambalya is hot and spicy - so kids don't like it.  The black beans & rice is a little spicy too - but subtle.  Mainly it's zesty and hearty and delicious.  My children eat it.  My little son just devours it - and has since he was a tot.  My daughter less so.  Actually I think I love this stuff more than my wife - so maybe there's a gender thing going on.  It's a little greasy when made properly.  I recommend using 2 1/2 cups of water, instead of the 2 3/4 it recommends on the box - for thicker, less soupy rice.  The foil lined container is bug proof and keeps for a long time.  Because it's a big flavor it sits best next to something assertive - like steak or blackened anything.

This is a strong, crisp, zesty licorice flavor.  It's really an exhilarating flavor.  As I sip it, the aftertaste reminds me very much of Altoid's Liquorice which is the strongest licorice flavored thing I've ever tasted.  This nearly rivals the Altoids in strength ... but this is even better because of the Matcha.  The Matcha offers its creamy consistency and slightly buttery, sweet vegetative tones to the sip, which softens the sharper notes of the licorice in a very appealing way, creating a flavor that reminds me of black Jelly Bellys ... as if someone took black Jelly Bellys and liquified them and stirred them into a bowl of Matcha.<br /><br />It is so good.

Licorice in tea is one of my favorite things of all time, and the Licorice Mint tea from Red Leaf Tea is a must for me when I'm sick. And while I love allsorts, any other licorice candy is not for me. I just think it's vile. Every Easter my mother would gleefully sit by as I sorted out all of the black jelly beans from my basket. She was the only one in the family who liked them. Is there anything more gross than popping what you think is a purple jellybean into your mouth, only to discover it was a horrible, horrible, licorice one? Blegh! But allsorts....mmm. They've become a bit of tradition in our family. They're impossible to find in Tennessee, so when I'm sending a package to my folks I always include Coffee Crisp for my mom and allsorts for my dad. That is, if I can keep myself from eating them all before the package goes out! Trust me, it happens more often than I care to admit.<br /><br />I kept eyeing this tea, adding it to my shopping cart and then removing it in favor of another flavor of matcha, adding it back to my wishlist. I finally bit the bullet and I'm here to find out if this is an allsort or a black jellybean.<br /><br />It's not a black jellybean at all! It is a lovely sweet licorice that soothes the throat and makes me unbelievably happy. I was very scared of this blend, but those fears were unfounded. It is delicious and definitely one I need to keep around for when I'm sick but I have to deal with work anyway. Completely lovely. It's not really an allsort either, it's the licorice I've come to know and love in teas. I should have expected that, but I was scared by the picture on the website.<br /><br />Licorice tends to polarize people. You either love it or you hate it. I'm one of those who loves it, but my wife is one who hates it. If it's in a tea, she can taste it, and it bothers her. But for me...oh, I love it and this matcha is beautiful in the balance of flavor to matcha. I want to make a large mug of this, but I have other matchas to taste and review!"

It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com."

We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?"

I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework - research the Canidae ALS problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets.<br />----<br />It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.<br /><br />I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'<br /><br />All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members."

That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it ""Canidae"" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip"

I did alot of research and read alot of labels.  I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me.  As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!

I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.""  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple."
19569,B000084ETV,A1H7CKOA2DQJU0,Effie,20,23,1,1219017600,WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae."

Van Deventer,20,23,1,1218326400,Lost a loyal customer- changed formula without notifying customers,My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.
19571,B000084ETV,A3NTV9VHMBY1KH,"Kimberly A. Kubek ""Doodle lover""",9,9,4,1175731200,Very good ingredient list with extras.,"I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it."

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good)."

And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called ""made here."" I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them.

19576,B000084ETV,A3DAXM59DANA8Z,Gemma Zanowski,7,7,5,1170028800,The best product for the price,"After reading the book ""Deadly Feasts"" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!"

It's unfortunate that Canidae didn't announce that they were going to change the formula because it's making a lot of dogs sick due to the sudden change in food.

However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased.

However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats."

She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like."

As many people know Jacks are an extemely active breed and keeping weight on them can be a problem.  We were feeding Flint River, a very high quality food,  both of my jacks were getting 2 cups a day just to maintain a slightly below average weight. My papillon was at the proper weight but still getting 1.5 cups of flint river a day.  We decided to switch foods and after much debate we chose canidae.  During the time it took to slowly switch foods(14 days) my jacks had already gained weight and were looking much better.  After 3 weeks we had to reduce their food becuase they were getting fat!  now my jacks eat 1/2 a cup twice daily and they have never looked better.  My papillon eats 1/4 cup AM and 1/2 cup PM.  Just the reduction in food alone has saved so much money.  Because we are feeding less there is less poop to clean up.  I really cannot say enough about this food its has made my dogs more balanced mentally and physically."

Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a ""hot spot"" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an ""allergic reaction.""  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural.

You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name brand foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing.

I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.<br /><br />On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula."

Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />""Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.""<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />""We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.""<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The ""Canidae Team"" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?"

I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.

One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain-free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy.

I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now.

Very slowly.

That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.

As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials.

In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.

I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue.

Now i wont bash any brands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog, be a good owner and look for things they like and react well to :-)..... now that being said i had a neurotic on edge dog with huge shedding issues and RR's don't shed. This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better."

What baffles me is how there can be so many great experiences listed here and then see those bad ones. I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway, my kids are very active for their age and doing great on Canidae and Felidae. It seems to be the best combination of high-quality ingredients and reasonable price out there.

Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.<br /><br />I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff."

The dogs not only gobble it up - they do not get upset tummies.  I have been feeding my pack of competitive working dogs (Border Collies and Australian Shepherds) for 6 years and about 30 boarding dogs per day and I have not found anything even close to the quality and value of Canidae.  Many kennels try to cut corners on feed but I believe paying a little more for Canidae has made money.  The dogs feel great, the kennels stay clean, and the owners have peace of mind.

I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side."

He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.

We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the ""customer service representative"" if you can call her that, simply said ""if you don't like it then don't buy it."" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any ""stickers"" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it."

If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again."

We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.

They were ""healthy"", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of ""junk"" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before.

You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.

I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it."

It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum brand a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products."

(Loved the old formulation).,"My 9-month-old absolutely adored the old recipe of this product, which was organic chicken, sweet potatoes, and brown rice pasta.  She would gobble up an entire pouch every time we offered it to her, and often ask for more.  Unfortunately, Happy Baby had to go and ruin a good thing by reformulating the product!  The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.  I definitely won't be buying this product again, unless Happy Baby goes back to the old formulation.  Grade: D-"

My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to ""improve"" upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten."

But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now.

My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors."

It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go."

I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato-based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1/2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little ""mmms"" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.

It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option."

I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched."

I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients."

If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.

The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.

I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila!

I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.

It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.

19828,B00390T5JA,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,Blythe Dresser,1,2,5,1326672000,We really couldn't be happier and now our Cusinart is in retirement...,"My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM"">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE"">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website."
19829,B00390T5JA,AD502O9GJJJQA,ROEJA,1,2,4,1325894400,Good machine but kind of  a rip off.,"This is a great Coffee/Tea/Hot Water Maker. It Heats the water very quickly, brews very quickly, and its very easy to clean. The only problem I have with it is the price of the ""K-Cups"". At Sams Club you can buy them in packs of 80 for $36.  This is a great deal compared to Walmart (Which was a pack of 16 for $12.)but that's still $0.45 per cup. If you were to drink 1 cup of coffee every day, for a year, it would cost you about $165. On the other hand, the same amount of Folgers canned coffee would cost you about $10.6 per year at $0.2 per 6 ounce serving. And of course that would be even less if you went with an off brand coffee. So overall the Keurig is a good machine, and a good deal if you use the reusable filter. This is what I will be using most of the time because of the price of k-cups. Until they sell 1800 k -cups for $36 (the price of 80 cups at sam's) they just aren't worth it. So If you decide to buy this machine I DEFINITELY recommend the reusable k cup."

It fills your cup up about to the 1/2 or less mark.  The K Cups are too expensive to just get 1/2 cup of coffee!  The taste of the coffee in this one is kind of a chemical taste.

It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well."

All pipes inside are cheap plastic. Even a $25 Mr Coffee has copper water pipes in it to carry the 190 degree water but not Keurig....all plastic water lines. Heat plugs the lines up in 3 to 4 months. Piece of cheap junk made to look pretty. Save your money
19849,B00390T5JA,A1J9FMHULAAZ9B,J. Willoughby,6,7,5,1335830400,"Yeah for Keurig, Square Trade, and Green Mountain.com","My first Keurig was purchased in January 2011 from Macy's.  It died on 4/29/12.  It worked that morning but later in the day the power light was out and nothing we did to try and revive it worked.  I was disappointed that the unit died after only 15 months, but it was on 16 hours or more per day and had worked perfectly up until its sudden demise. I never had any problems with the prime as some people have reported and can only hope my next unit will work as well.<br /><br />Because I had heard of Keurigs failing just after the warranty, I had purchased a 3 year warranty for it from Square Trade.  It's an online company that provides reasonably priced warranties for a wide variety of products.  I contacted them the day the unit failed and received an email with an Amazon gift card number within 24 hours of my contact.  The card included a 5% promotional credit from their partnership with Amazon so it was actually a little more than I paid for the first unit.  My next Keurig will arrive 5/3/12. (Note:  I did have to ship them the burned out unit but they provide the shipping costs via a UPS shipping label.  The hard part was getting a big enough box and enough packing materials so that cost me a little over $5. Next time I'll keep the box.)<br /><br />I have read good things about Keurig customer service and their replacing brewers out of warranty due to priming problems, but since I already had this warranty and it wasn't a priming problem, I didn't contact Keurig.  They might have been helpful too - I don't know.<br /><br />Before I knew Square Trade would come through so quickly, we went to the store and bought a Mr. Coffee brewer for $79.00.  Our intent is just to use it until the new Keurig comes and then put it in our travel trailer for weekend trips (instead of taking the Keurig with us).  While the Mr. Coffee is quieter, it takes much longer to heat the water and we have yet to get rid of an odd after taste from it.  I'm going to run vinegar through it to see if that helps but so far it is rather disappointing.<br /><br />Another side note:  I buy my coffee from Green Mountain.com online.  If you join their club you get a pretty decent discount and they sell 24 pack product, not the 18 that you buy in the store.  If you join the club (automatic shipments) and order 4 or more at a time they pay the shipping. You can set the interval at the number of weeks that is right for you and it's easy to change if your circumstances change.  Recently they included free samples (a full 24 cup box) of their hot apple cider.  That wouldn't happen at the grocery store.<br /><br />In summary, I love my Keurig.  Being without it for a few days has really made me realize how much I love it.  Is it more expensive than a pot of brewed coffee - yes.  But to me it is well worth it.  I will buy another Square Trade warranty though - just to be safe.<br /><br />Addendum 5/3/12.  My new unit came today.  I had ordered the Classic (B44) because I could get Prime Shipping.  I mistakenly thought it was the same as the Elite (B40).  It's not.  The cup sizes are smaller.  You have two choices, but the larger one is only 7.25 oz, not 9.25 like the Elite.  That was a huge disappointment.  They don't show the cup sizes in either of the write-ups on Amazon and it's not easy to find in writing anyplace.  Because I can't return it, we're going to put this one in the trailer, return the Mr. Coffee to the store (still tastes funny after 3 days including a white vinegar cleaning) and get the Elite 40 for home use.  Live and learn."
19850,B00390T5JA,A23GFTVIETX7DS,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,6,7,4,1327276800,Mid-Line Keurig Model,"Even though the product description states that this machine has three cup sizes, it has only two, and the largest is not as large as the mug-size on the top-of-the-line Keurig models.  This model fits right in the middle of Keurig machines:  it has the reservoir that the Mini Brewer lacks and yet is not as expensive as the top of the line machines.<br /><br />Since we also have the B60 model (I bought this for my daughter to use), I can tell you that the difference between the two models is small but significant:<br /><br />1. This one only brews the smallest and the mid-size cups.  If you want the large size, you can brew a mid-size cup, lift the arm, put it back down, and brew a small size through the same pod.  (It's about the same amount of water that goes through a single pod when brewing the largest size on the B60.)<br /><br />2. The construction isn't as heavy-duty as the B60's, although it's good enough, in my opinion.<br /><br />3. It doesn't look quite as nice as the B60 because it lacks the stainless drip grate and the silver accents.<br /><br />4. It takes a little longer to heat the water.<br /><br />In general, this is just a stripped down version of the B60 which makes it more affordable.  The coffee is just as good.  Because we bought a Keurig Mini Brewer for my husband's office, I realized that the reservoir is an important feature to have because otherwise it takes a lot longer to brew a single cup.  This machine has some of the strengths found in the best of the Keurig machines but at a more moderate price.  When comparing prices, keep in mind that some models found in stores offer extras such as a coffee sample pack or filter.  This one -- at least as I bought it -- contains nothing extra.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

I ordered the Keurig K-Cup Home Brewer and I received it.  I just do not understand the 6 oz and 8 oz cups because the coffee does not come out to the full amount.  This is a problem and I do not understand why this is happening?  If I put it on the 8 oz it comes to a half a cup not the full size.
19852,B00390T5JA,A1TF9EYT8FEPZP,C. E. Dalli Cardillo,3,3,5,1325980800,"Happy with it, but remember to DESCALE the unit!",I have had this model for a little over a year and am quite happy with it.  It functions well and like any Keurig product is easy to use.  I purchased the ecobrew filters since I prefer to grind my own coffee and it is far less expensive.  Recently however I was getting very little water despite pushing the button for the larger cup.  I had not descaled my machine as I only use water that has come through the Zero Water filter system and the fact that the descale light never came on.  I decided to descale anyway and after I did it is back to its normal performance level.  Lesson learned - DESCALE AS RECOMMENDED EVEN IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON!

We've only had ours for 2 weeks, but we absolutely love it! For the holidays, it was so perfect - my daughter's made espresso for their lattes, my husband his Breakfast Brew, my teens made hot chocolate, and I had several cups of decaf hazelnut. It's so quick and easy, the whole family loves it!  It's great for making tea too!  Two small cups make a full mug, and one large cup leaves just enough room to add Bailey's. :)"
19854,B00390T5JA,A3VU2J7G0U35AU,Jaybird,3,3,5,1325203200,"Hot, Perfect Tea, Anyone?","I ordered this lovely machine for myself for Christmas after getting very tired of endless teabags sitting in cups all over my house. I thought, wow, wouldn't it be great to have a wonderful, strong cup of tea without fishing out tea bags all the time, and getting some strong, some weak cups of tea? With the Keurig, I have perfect hot tea, herbal and black and green, on-demand and at a perfect, strong strength.<br /><br />I have to admit, I knew Keurig did great coffee, but tea? I thought that, normally having to brew longer, tea might not be all that great in this kind of machine. I was happily proven wrong.<br /><br />One trick to getting the most out of your tea K-cup? It won't tell you this in the directions, but each cup fill-up is triggered by lifting the handle up and then down. So, I pop my tea cup in there, get the first large, strong cup, then I lift the handle (same cup in there) and lower it, then press the smaller cup and fill up my mug more. And I even tried getting another cup out of the same K-cup! Tea seems to go really far.<br /><br />For coffee, I tried one large then one small out of the same K-cup. Works great and I get a larger amount for my giant latte-sized mugs.<br /><br />I can also make a great, fast cup of low-cal hot chocolate by popping my powdered mix into the mug, leaving out a K-cup, and just using the machine to put out hot water on-demand. Sure beats having to mess with a microwave or traditional teapot.<br /><br />I also got the EKObrew manually refillable K-cup, so I can use loose tea and coffee when I want.<br /><br />The machine itself it quick to warm up, heat the water, and stay in the ready mode. I know people who leave their ""power"" button on 24/7, but I think this might wear the machine out faster, plus waste electricity. I turn mine off when I'm done because it really doesn't take but a few seconds to get the water hot and ready to go again.<br /><br />This particular model is fairly large on the counter due to the generous water reservoir, so allow some room for its depth. Fits great under the standard height cupboard space due to the smart handle design not needing much vertical room to open up.<br /><br />Noise includes normal water-heating and filling sounds, so nothing surprising there.<br /><br />All in all, a great, convenient, time-saving machine."

It isn't cheap per cup, but since I'm the only person in the house who drinks coffee, it's a reasonable solution.<br /><br />However, having used it for coffee a few times, I then tried one of the tea packets that came with it. It tasted like ... coffee.<br /><br />I've tried cleaning the brewing unit thoroughly -- flakes of coffee end up in all sorts of nooks and crannies -- and running plain water through it over and over. Didn't help; still a definite coffee taste to the tea.<br /><br />I suspect that attacking it with an even deeper cleaning would help, but I can't see doing that every time I want to try it for tea -- and I certainly wouldn't want to try it with the other packets available, like cider.<br /><br />So, if you just want to use it for one type of drink, it's great."

I think the ""Microprocessor Controlled Technology"" that ""maintains water at the perfect brewing temperature "" has failed? Who knows? it works 1/2 the time now, the other half it won't deliver any water. Next week I'll bet I'll be looking for a new one.

I learned a very valuable lesson.<br /><br />This machine has a selection for two cup sizes, 5.25 or 7.25 oz, neither of which are very large.  And you can't really use a K-cup twice.  Trust me, I tried.<br /><br />Other than the small sizes I like my Keurig.  So I can't blame the machine because it is what it is."

The larger mug option doesn't fill up a travel cup. I have to brew one cup of the larger and then one cup of the smaller for the travel cup to fill up. I use the same k cup and the coffee to water ratio is perfect for me. I also bought the reusable cups for the machine but find that they don't work very well and tend to waste coffee. It doesn't brew a strong enough cup. Maybe I have not perfected the grinds. I'll stick to my press for the weekend and k cups for the weekday. I love how quickly it brews and the temperature is perfect.  I do wish the resevoir was larger though. It is a pain in the butt having to refill constantly. You do have to run it a few times when first using as the other reviews say. There is a strong plastic smell that took about 5 brews to get rid of.

It makes perfect cups of coffee over and over again. I have tried several Kcups, and you can find the one thats right for you with so many options on the market. I will say this: When you first buy it, it will smell funny after you turn it on. The heating element takes a little time and gives off that smell. The book states to run one cup water through before using. I did it several times throught a couple hr period, and the smell went away.

It makes a strong, hot cup every time, which is a huge improvement over our standard pot of coffee maker. I was a little worried about the cost of each cup, but if you shop around and check the price per cup you can save a lot of money. Costco seems to be the best deal, but you need to buy 80 cups at a time. This is not an issue for us because we drink a lot of coffee. We bought a sampler box at Sears and that gave us an idea of what we like. I also bought 2 EkoBrew reusable k-cups (the reviews on the Keurig reusable cups were not good) so that we have the option of using up our bulk coffee. The water is easy to refill, no spills. I empty the leftover coffee from each k-cup into a container and then use that as fertilizer in my plants. We also just discovered k-cups at Costco from the SF Bay company which don't have the plastic bottom, just  the filter which reduces the plastic going into landfill. Plus they were only $25.99 for 80 cups (.37 per cup!). Great company, tasty coffee. Highly recommend this coffee maker!"

When leaving my last job I was given a home brewer as a parting gift by my co-workers.  I was thrilled to have one at home as I usually drink coffee at home only on weekends. Before I was always brewing a larger pot than I needed and throwing a lot out, or drinking more than I really wanted so as not to waste it.  Even though the K-cups are more expensive, just knowing I can make one cup of great coffee anytime the mood strikes is great! Sometimes I want one cup after dinner and this is perfect!  I've read some of these reviews talking about the cup sizes; if I select the large cup serving, it almost runs out of a regular/medium cup,especially if I pre-add a little half & half.  I feel the taste is always consistent.  I like the Donut Shop for mornings and the Tully's Kona Blend for the evenings.  I just purchased the Ekobrew and am anxious to try it this weekend.

No matter how convenient or easy, no matter the choices of coffee, forget everything else- there is a huge problem with the way they made the maker itself.  The hinged clam-shell of the K-cup holder uses an amazingly poorly designed plastic track.  This track is formed in a complex set of curves that the mated piece must follow.  The pieces are simply bare, dry, plastic.  Over time they start to drag and catch as they try to follow this complex curve as you open and close the clam-shell.  When the inevitable dragging and catching starts, the K-cups suffer a jagged puncture from the upper piercing water fill piece.  This is catastrophic because anything less than a perfect small hole allows coffee grounds to flood out the top of the K-cup during the brew.<br />Once this happens, you will never know if the next brew will work normally or you'll get coffee grounds everywhere.<br />Just Google Keurig hole problem.  It is common and after taking this thing apart to see how it all works, obvious that the design is flawed."

It turns out that steaming pressure gets more out of the beans than traditional coffee makers.<br /><br />At $10.00 a pound (we live in the Caribbean) for coffee, I reckon a new Keurig will pay for itself in TWO MONTHS.<br /><br />This morning's early trip to the store because we're no longer used to buying so much coffee prompted me to do the math and decide that I'll just keep ordering these coffeemakers and hope that soon, a more reliable model comes along."

I highly recommend this coffee maker. You can do two sizes and with the assortment of different K-cups available you could make a different type of coffee everyday. It is faster than I could have expected and the coffee is very good too. It was the perfect gift and I will enjoy it for years to come I am sure.

And with the plethora of K-Cup options out there (teas, hot chocolates, etc.) your hot beverages options are next to limitless. This unit doesn't include any K-cups, so just make sure to order some along with it, or look at the EkoBrew reusable K-Cup as an option (see my other reviews)."

I would make 4 cups of coffee and often wind up throwing away half.  Now I have two cups of caffeinated coffee, a couple cups of decaffeinated,  a cup or two of tea (either made with a pod or a tea bag--yes you can get just a cup of piping hot water for your tea), and hot chocolate.  It takes less than a minute to brew a cup of coffee; just enough time to go to the fridge and get the cream or milk.  We have started to use the 'eKobrew' pods, which makes it possible to make our own  blends and we do not have a little plastic pod to throw away."

I picked it initially because it was one of the more affordable, nicer ones. From what I can see its, great! it makes coffee almost instantly. The only thing I noticed is this Keurig is made cheaper than the more expensive ones, for example I own the 179.99 Keurig and the handle and base are made out of metal while this one's handle and base are made out of plastic. Its not necessarily a bad thing its just something I noticed. And its kind of unfortunate that it only allows you to choose two sizes of coffee and thats it. Basically what i'm trying to say is for someone like me whose a mild coffee drinker its great! But for someone who drinks coffee more often you might want to spring for one of the more expensive ones that allow you to be specific on different settings such as cup size and temperature."

So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee - Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their ""fix."") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded ""half cup"" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.<br /><br />I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better.

Once set up(~5 minutes) and warmed up(~2 minutes) you can have a hot cup of coffee, tea, cocoa, or a few other things in just a matter of seconds! This really has changed the game. Would you rather a fresh hot cup of coffee or that last cup from the bottom of the pot that's been on the burner for an hour? This allows you to have that fresh hot cup every time.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that talk about it making too much noise. I don't see what they are talking about. The only think I can imagine would be when the pump sucks the water into the heater. While noticeable, that sound is a dull hum at best. I can't see it being a reason not to get one of these.<br /><br />With so many great options for coffee and more this machine has been in constant use since it arrived.

At work, I would drink one cup of coffee in the morning because it was there.  I found that that one cup really got me going in the morning, and also in the afternoons if I was feeling drowsy.  I started working from home and found that I missed that coffee.  I purchased this basic Keurig because it has everything a one cupper needs, nothing more.  I love it!  My only complaint is that it only lasted one year.  I attempted to dscale it, and it never worked right again.  I bought the same machine again and am hoping for a longer life.  I would recommend this product to all the one cuppers of the world.  Just be sure to descale on a regular basis."

I had to descale it once during that time but I usually use purified water for coffee so I wouldn't imagine I would have to do that again for another year.  There are two cup sizes.  One is a normal cup and one is a stronger cup.  If you are looking to fill up a mug, you can hit the smaller cup size twice.  I find that is perfect because I buy the stronger blend coffees.<br /><br />The only problem I have had was a couple of times I had to turn it off and on a few times to get the water to flow through the k cups.  All in all, not a hardship<br /><br />I am going to buy one for my son this year and am not sure which model to get.  This standard has worked great for me so I may just get the same."

I easily gulped it down before my full study was complete. Down the end of ingredients there is artificial green grape flavor...we all need that...to match the green bottle I guess.<br />  After I mixed it 50/50 with filtered water I was able to actually taste other than sweet and it was not bad with a bit of pulp that I liked as in pulp orange juice.  I added some pure Aloe Juice to get it closer to the health drink I stupidly assumed associated with Aloe... and will make it thru the case I ordered.<br /><br /> I suppose if your looking for a better after school replacement drink than say..

Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's.

I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the ""World Market"" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says ""It's OK.""
