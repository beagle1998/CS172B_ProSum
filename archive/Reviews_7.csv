Yes, there does seem to be some sort of ""grit"" in the beef jerky, but I'm not really too bothered by it.

She was right, it was excellent and made for a delicious snack enroute to Las Vegas. The jerky isn't hard, but not really soft either. Just a nice balance of texture. The heat comes on slow and takes a few pieces to really be felt, but the sweetness of the jerky is just right, so TASTY! Give this jerky a try, it's wonderful that these come in 1lb bags.

We have tried a vast majority of jerky out there, and can tell a good jerky from bad.  I have no idea how can anyone leave this jerky a positive, not to mention gleaming review.  Must be the first time trying jerky.  FIRST:  there is NOTHING natural about this jerky.  Few noticed, but their packaging used to say ""all natural"", but NO MORE, because they know it is not.  Now it says "" naturally hickory smoked"", or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).<br /><br />i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.<br /><br />OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package."

While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself."

It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it."

Unfortunately, I found out to my dismay that they did truly charge me $6.00 for just one package when you can buy this in a store for approximately $1.00 per package.

Blankenship,2,2,1,1332115200,"IGNORE MY STAR RATING AS IT RELATES TO THE PRODUCT (WE LOVE THIS STUFF), BUT APPLY IT TO THE PRICE HERE.","Due to our cooking habits we use a lot of avocados in preparing our meals.  From Mexican food to salads and sandwiches and of course Guacamole Dip, they are an important part of our dietary intake.  The Guacamole dip is a favorite in our household and my wife has at least six different recipes she prepares it with.  We do though use and try out various prepared mixes such as this McCormick brand...which by the way, is one of our favorites. This adds variety and we do love variety! I can tell you right now that if I were grading this product on quality and eating enjoyment I would give it five stars in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am giving this particular one a one star review and if it were possible, I would give it less.  Did you read the price on this thing!  I must tell you that the first reviewer here saved me a bunch of coin and a major temper meltdown.  Thank you Dutch for pointing the price of this product out to me.  I was actually ready to hit the purchase button on this one after I had added it to my shopping cart.  Thank goodness I had second thoughts and went back and read the review.  This product, when we purchase it at or local store cost around one dollar.  This is a somewhat reasonable price.  Did you realize that these folks are selling ONE PACKAGE (ONE OZ) for a total of $6.00!  Either this seller is trying a big time rip off or there has been a major typographical error here.  In either case there is NO WAY I am going to plunk out that much money for this stuff...as good as it is!<br /><br />Anyway, the mix itself is quite good.  We use a lot of McCormick products and have yet to find one we are dissatisfied with.  But the price here is absolutely outrageous to the point of being offensive.<br /><br />End of review but as long as we are talking about saving money.....<br /><br />Did you folks know you can freeze avocados?  Yup, for dip and spreads freezing these things works perfectly.  I am not sure how things are in your part of the country, but here in our little part of the world the price of avocados goes through wild fluctuations.  I have quite often seen them selling for $1.50 apiece!  No there is no way that I am going to pay that much for one of these things.  On the other hand, we often, for one reason or another, find these things relatively dirt cheap.  I just purchased a whole bunch of the things for .32 cents apiece.<br /><br />When we find these on sale like this be buy a great number of them.  We take them home, let them ripen to our taste, wash and dry them and then stick them in freezer bags...usually three our four or our family.  When we want to whip up a batch of dip or spread, we simply take them out of the freeze, let them thaw and we are in business.  After they have been frozen the skins simply slip right off and you can mush them up quite easily.  This dose not work if you like sliced avocados for salads or sandwiches as they are too soft and mushy. On the other hand, it makes great dip and spread.  We cannot tell the difference in the flavor of the frozen ones over the fresh.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"

Seriously, the BEST quick indian food I've ever had (and I've had a lot!).  My in-laws are from Kerala, and I wouldn't be embarrassed to cook them a meal using these sauces (and then hide the evidence, of course!  what?  me use a pre-made sauce?? never!)  Everything I've ever tried, from the vindaloo to the masala to the spice mixes for potatoes, etc, have been wonderful, and you can switch up the meat (I usually use chicken breast, but sometimes use lamb or pork instead, and sometimes just veggies).  Last night was the first time my husband and I had tried the korma, and it might be our favorite now.  It's got a bit of a kick to it, which is unfortunately rare in most americanized indian sauces.  I added skim milk instead of cream, and it still came out great.  I usually saute onions first (but not always - if I'm in a hurry, they get left out), then brown about a pound of meat, next the sauce packet and milk, and then add a a couple of boiled potatoes (cubed) and half a can of peas.  I then simmer until the potatoes have absorbed the flavor.  Each packet is for about a pound of meat or veggies, but I've used one packet for a pound of meat plus about half a pound of veggies and it was fine - very strong, concentrated sauce.  Last night I used 2 packets because I used about a pound and 1/2 of chicken breast, 2 large potatoes, and peas, and the meal lasts for about 3 night for the two of us. It makes for a easy, fast meal, and goes great with rice or naan.  If you live near a specialty grocery store, you might check to see if they carry the frozen sukhi's meals, too.

They're also great for snack time and it's good to know that they are healthy and count towards her daily fruit & veggie servings, when fresh fruit and veggies are not readily available.  I also love that both flavors of these fruit & veggie melts are a completely mess free snack, which is always a plus. :)"
35151,B004SKQ60Q,ASBLUZWS98EM2,"SoCalAvAZ ""SoCalAvAZ""",1,1,5,1314748800,These are a favorite,"Out of all the snacks out there and all the ones my daughter has tried, these are her all time favorite.  Even if she's full, even if she won't eat anything else, she will never say no to these.<br /><br />They smell great, although admittedly I've never tried them to see what they taste like.  They melt very easily in her mouth, don't crumble or leave a mess.  They're also just the perfect bite size for my 14 month old.<br /><br />I prefer the tropic version over the berry version because it's colorless.  The berry version, once wet, can stain chairs/clothes.  It comes out but now you have to spend your night cleaning the stains out.  A few time my daughter ended up sitting on them after dropping them and the colored stained her stroller.  And once she somehow managed to get her water on them, perhaps it dripped, and that was a huge mess.  So I learned to stick with the tropical, and she doesn't mind.<br /><br />The price here is much higher than the grocery store though.  I usually get them for 2.99 a pack and there's quite a few in the package."

He absolutely loves every single flavor and would eat the whole bag if I let him.  I use them mainly for snacks on the go and the resealable bag makes it easy to toss in our diaper bag.  I usually buy a lot of my baby items from Amazon but I actually get these from the grocery store because they are much cheaper than here.

I usually buy them separately, but what I do not understand is, why or how come they don't tell us what's in the Sampler Bag or bags!? Besides the Cold Sampler descriptor on the box, nowhere on the page do they break down what else is part of the ""COLD SAMPLER"" box. That's rather frustrating to me! I need more info in order to feel good about what I'm buying!"

So far he has tried the chicken and beef. He was a picky eater to begin with and was starting to get alarmingly thin because he won't eat his kibble. I tried topping it with different things like plain yogurt and nothing. He still won't eat his kibble. I decided to try the raw medallions and he eats with so much gusto! Also he has gained some weight (a great thing) and looks so much healthier now. His coat is looking better and better everyday. Also his poop is so much smaller. I noticed that the goop from his eyes is slowly disappearing. It is pricier than kibble, but for a tiny dog, it really is not that much. It is way worth the price. Will recommend to anyone who will listen."
