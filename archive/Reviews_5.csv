My two dogs changed my mind, and a friend's dog has also tried it and given her approval too! All three dogs thoroughly enjoyed learning to move the individual flaps of the puzzle toy to release one and then both tennis balls, and then moving the center piece to slide up or down, revealing treats! All of the dogs figured the puzzle out within minutes, and each has their own style. My Rott paws it open, bashing it with his giant paws. My Lab nosed it for a while, then picked it up and tossed it. My friend's Terrier mix nosed it open. This is a great way to keep the dogs thinking and to give an outlet for some mental energy. I thought it was flimsy, but so far even with the abuse dished out by close to 200 lbs of dog so far, it only has a few minor scratches, so I would say it is holding up nicely!<br /><br />The bad: the dogs solve it too quickly, and there is no way to make it harder.

I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were. The more 'biddable' bitch was attracted, but the more 'rambunctious' male stayed nosing and chewing at different angles until he discovered how to lift the cups and get to the treats inside. He quickly became an expert and was easily lifting and dropping the cups, while his friend stayed close and occasionally sneaked a treat out before her could get to it. Don't leave the dogs to play with the cups, or they'll chew them out of shape and they won't lift out as easily. Great fun and gave us a better understanding of the dogs."

The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5"" deep, 2 1/8"" wide and 2 1/4"" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow."

He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it.

We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw.

They are hard plastic, but they are fairly thick and don't give even to a hard squeeze. My dogs all realized that the object was to get the covers out of the way, not to chew on them, so that may be the issue. My 4-month-old German Shepherd figured this out very quickly and even put the little covers back on after all the treats were gone, as if she expected them to refill magically, lol! It took my 3-year-old golden retriever a bit more time to figure out and she used her paws quite a bit whereas the puppy was all teeth. It was very interesting to see them try different ways of figuring out the puzzle. However, my 3-year-old malamute is kind of a baby and he tried very briefly before he looked at me and started to whine. Clearly it's not as much fun for a furbaby who is used to having everything handed to him! My girls still get very excited every time we pull this out though. We always use a high value treat in the puzzle, something special that they don't get every day. They will play the game over and over and over as many times as I refill it. I definitely think this is something most dogs can do on their own if you need to keep them busy for 10-15 minutes but my girls seems to enjoy it even more when I'm there cheering them on every time they have a success. The materials are very durable, in my opinion, and clean up couldn't be easier.

When we gave it to him the next day, he knew exactly what he was doing and got all the treats out within two minutes.  We even timed it.  Now, as soon as we set it on the floor, it takes only a few seconds for him to get each compartment open, and we don't give it to him very often.  It's a cute/fun way to deliver some treats, but it's not long before he's looking at us like, ""Okay, now what?  What's next??""<br /><br />Pros: Opens easily so it's not too frustrating.  The star design makes compartments a bit more challenging if the treats are pushed further inside.  You can put a dab of peanut butter in a few, and it will take him longer to lick it out, but you might have to clean it after.  The grips on the underside really help hold it in place so that he doesn't slide it around the floor too far or too quickly. It has withstood his strong bite/chewing.

The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it."

We play it every single day. Often to work on obedience (sit, get it, down, get it!) and just for fun administration of treats and even dinner. My golden retriever loves it, but is a chewer, so he must be supervised with it. He pulled the cups out and thought that in itself was the reward... LOL  but once I simply pointed to the treat hidden in the pawprint dish, he figured it out and was a happy camper. I also bought the spinner, which is actually my favorite of the two styles. I can get my golden's entire kibble allotment for one meal (we feed twice a day) inside it, so it slows down his feeding (so he doesn't gulp it down and get bloat). I know that my dogs love it by the perked ears and bouncing when they see me pick one of the toys up. They also sit and wait to be ""released"" to start their game. Great fun! The plastic is nice too since you can disinfect it easily or wash it in the sink without worrying about warping, splitting, or cracking wood like on the expensive models of similar toys.

They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!"

She finished her meal in 20 minutes and then grabbed a chew toy and jumped on the couch. I know Lily likes this toy and so do I. The price makes it extremely likable also.

25117,B0081XIA1E,A11IDK9L74LPT1,C. Schmidt,10,11,2,1336176000,Good idea - implemention flawed. Maybe good for small dogs.,"I recently got this Kyjen Kibble Drop puzzle toy for our two dogs. We have a 65 lb German Shepherd Dog and a 60 lb Golden Retriever. Both have been learning ""nosework"" so I thought this would be a fun toy to add to our scenting games.  I plan to use it by dropping one yummy treat at a time and having them find and get it from one of the 4 cups.<br /><br />I'll give you my conclusion first, and then you can decide if you want to read the details below for more info (including size of the toy info).<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />I don't see how this toy could just be put on the ground and left for your dog to get the food out of the cups. Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective ""nosing the flap"" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10"" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4"" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4"" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2""x2"" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1"".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could ""find"" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2"" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she ""finds"" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-"

So I try to find anything I can to keep his mind busy and hopefully wear him out.  He figured this toy out fast and gets his food in about 2 minutes, but he does really love it and he often settles down after playing with it.  My other dog (the chi x you see in the picture) has absolutely no interest in working for his food. So I guess it's not for all dogs, but if your dog is busy, this is a good way to occupy him for awhile."

He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it."

So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.  The vet told us that once he acclimated to his new owners and surroundings, his appetite would pick up.  Well, it didn't.  After two months, he still would not eat very much out of his bowl.  He would take 3-4 bites and would walk away from all his food.  My husband and I had to force our dog to eat or hand feed him - neither of which we liked.<br /><br />I read up on dachshunds and found out that they are hunting dogs.  I thought that maybe if we made getting his meal a bit more of a hunt or challenge that he would like it more - and sure enough, I was right!  Ever since we bought this star toy, he eats ALL his food with no problems!  It is such a relief not to have force or hand feed our dog and to not worry if our dog is getting enough food.  The fact that he enjoys it and likes it so much is just the icing on the cake and makes us so happy!  So, for our dog, it's more of an interactive feeder than a toy or brain game but we feel that it was well worth the money paid!<br /><br />We've had it about a month now and our dog eats out of it 1-2 times a day and it's holding up just fine.

It took them about 10-15 minutes of playing, barking and trying to get to the treats.  Eventually they figured out that the puzzle pieces ALL had to be removed before they could spin the base and reach their goal.  It was so much fun to watch.

This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the ""pegs"" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is ""buried"") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better.

I purchased both Kyjen's Triad and their Jigsaw Glider. My pooch went right for both, and my only (minor) complaint is that they're TOO easy.<br /><br />Forrest has mastered other treat toys, including the Aikou (done in under two minutes), and Nina Ottosson's Dog Magic and Tornado. With the Triad, he had the ""spin"" and ""flip"" mechanisms figured out in a few minutes. Keeping the flip doors open long enough to detract the treat, however, seemed to require some skill and practice. Not generally a ""cheater"", he finally resorted to flipping the whole unit upside down, to discover that doesn't work very well either, unless he kept rolling it over and over repeatedly. He did (during the initial test drive) get the hang of flipping the flap and keeping it up long enough to get his hard-fought reward. I may make mention that he has a long, narrow snout, and the patience of a saint once his tongue makes physical contact with food stuffs. A friend of mine has a young Border Collie/Karelian Bear Dog cross who is still figuring out all the parts to the Magic, so these Kyjen toys would be appropriate for him, as well as any dog just becoming familiar to puzzle toys, and learning how they work. It's also worth a mention that if you're not willing to sacrifice peace and quiet for your dog's amusement, do not purchase. Nor if you have squeaky-wheel neighbors living below your hard wood floors... unless they're out of town.<br /><br />My terrier has a short attention span, in that if it's TOO hard, he loses interest after a while. Not one for extreme challenges. Nina Ottosson's Twister is still a ""project in the works"", and not one I would recommend for first-timers and beginners.

Having  lived in Italy for two years, my tastebuds found the 'real deal' and upon returning to the US, I've been searching for something even remotely approaching the velvety luciousness of a good Roman pasta product.  No dice.  Most pasta products I've tried end up a little too gluey/glutinous.  Other than the 'gourmet' brands which can be purchased via Dean & Deluca or similar outlets (for similar, mind-boggling prices) I've had to settle.<br /><br />Not anymore!<br /><br />My fiance' was diagnosed with Type2 diabetes a few years ago.  When we started dating, I began modifying my pantry accordingly, figuring it might not be such a bad idea for me to start watching my carbs as well.  I found Carba Nada while searching for a good pasta, which though low in carbs, might still *hopefully* taste even remotely like pasta, without that 'stewed tennis shoe' taste and texture (Think of Chaplain's famous scene, eating a boiled boot and twirling the shoelaces, a'la Romana).<br /><br />Skepticism turned to stunned disbelief - the taste is amazing, truly a wonderful, slightly egg-flour-y, slightly nutty and naturally buttery.  The texture is perfection, light and springy and never, 'shoe-lacy' chewy.  Top it with a bit of light butter, butter substitute, garlic and romano and you have heaven on Earth.  A bit of light-cream based alfredo sauce and you have pure Heaven.  Partner it full-tilt with your best hearty meat-based sauces and you are in Orbit-Houston-We-Have-Tastebud-Liftoff.<br /><br />Have I made it clear that this is truly GOOD stuff?<br /><br />put the water on, I'll get the cheese grater.<br /><br />Nancy Harding, St. Louis, MO."

The first surprise was that it smelled exactly like regular hard semolina pasta while boiling (I really love that smell!) I like my pasta al dente and this was most definitely al dente and sturdy like a good pasta should be. I ate a few strands right out of the pot with nothing on them and was surprised at how much I liked it. Bonus: With all that extra protein and fiber in it, I was more stuffed eating what's considered 2 servings (4 dry ounces, like ""regular"" pasta) than I've ever been with the same amount of ""regular"" pasta but the Carba-Nada has fewer calories.

Even years after he left the scouts I remained involved at the large regional camp here for the boy scouts teaching survival training. And I still do a lot of hiking and camping on my own. Powdered spices, veggies, cheeses, bullion, and various stocks were a staple item on camping trips due to their convenience.  Some of the dry wares were much better than others.  This tomato powder was definitely one that turned out to be consistently convenient and tasty, and thus worthy of recommending.  We used it when we made stews and soups and it added a flavorful tomato taste to the various broths and stocks.  I would not recommend this product for making tomato soup since its rather costly, and besides, dried soups are easy and cheap for taking along on a hike.  It is best used in enriching the flavor of a soup or stew, whether it be a ready made mix, or one you are making from stock.  It is very rich and surprisingly good.  I took one star off for it is a little costly for only the 2 oz. you get.  But for what its designed for, it is worth the price since you don't use all that much at once.  As I have stated in my other reviews of dried foods like Barry Farm brands, there will always be a core group of consumers that would never give a favorable nod to a powdered food substitute of any kind.  This powder is definitely not going to remind you of the old home days of native tomato's from Grammas back yard for sure.  If you feel you are one of those that never considered a dry substitute of any kind real food, trust me that this is no time to start feeling like Daniel Boone by trying out this powder.  However if you are one that does a lot of hiking and camping where cooking your own meals over an open fire is a big part of that experience, by all means this tasty powder would greatly enliven that experience.

Then I noticed ""New & Improved Flavor."" What a joke.  The old flavor was delicious, and this one tastes just awful. This isn't just a minor difference.  There's no spearmint flavor at all, just a chemical taste and even worse after taste.  The ingredients are the same (sugar, corn syrup, natural flavor, stearic acid), so it must be the ""natural flavor"" which doesn't taste like anything natural to me.

Gould,2,2,1,1283990400,Great Deal on a Favorite Flavor - but many are crushed,"This is one of my favorite Life Savers flavors, and like almost all flavors, it has gotten hard to find it locally.<br /><br />I rarely see the roll version of anything other than Pep-O-Mint and Wint-O-Green. Remember the days when you could go into a store and find tons of Life Savers? Berry (was it called Mixed Berries or Wild Berry?), Tropical Fruits, Fancy Fruits, Wild Cherry, Butter Rum ... the original Five Flavor mix, and two of my long-gone favorites: Butter Mint and Tangerine! I really miss those days!<br /><br />I can still find the Butter Rum and Wild Cherry at my local pharmacy. They're both better for soothing a scratchy throat than any cough drop that they sell, so it makes sense that they'd have them there. In the supermarket I can often find them both - plus the new version of the Five Flavor mix (which isn't as good as the original), but these are individually wrapped candy in bags. They are bigger than the roll version, and I prefer the rolls.<br /><br />There was a gas station in my area that sold these Spear-O-Mint rolls, but they stopped about a year ago. I am so happy to have found a source for them here at Amazon. YIPPEE! Now if only they'd come back with the Tangerine and Butter Mint! I can't understand how the convenience store shelves can contain 100 different types of super mints (I can't stand the overpoweringly strong mints and gums sold today), but not make room for old fashioned, traditional Life Savers!<br /><br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />UPDATE:<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br /><br />I had originally given this product 5 stars, but I have now had to lower the rating to just 3 stars. I've opened six rolls of the Life Savers and three of them have contained completely crushed candies. Each mint is broken into 4-6 chunks and a bunch of minty powder. What a mess! Even the three that were not completely broken, were at least partially broken.<br /><br />The package seemed to be in good shape when it arrived with no signs of damage, so one can only assume that this damage was done before the product was shipped. I don't know how the remaining 14 rolls will size up, but it's not looking hopeful.<br /><br />I was so excited to receive this product, and now I am so disappointed.<br /><br /># # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #<br />FURTHER UPDATE:<br /># # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #<br /><br />I've now opened just about all of the rolls of Life Savers and every single roll (other than the first three good ones mentioned above) contained broken candy. Most were completely shattered or contained about 80% broken candy. Just a few rolls contained at least half unbroken candy. As I've said, the packaging was not damaged at all, so these were obviously broken before they were shipped out. Most likely, they were stored and/or handled improperly.<br /><br />Oh well. I guess that Life Savers are getting to be thing of the past. You can hardly find good flavors locally, and obviously mail order is not an option. This sure was a pricy lesson for me."

It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep-O-Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like ""conspicuously strong mints"" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re-flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep-O-Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint-O-Green or Spear-O-Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the ""new and [not] improved"" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their ""taste tests"" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear-O-Mint, which I also gave 5 stars]<br />These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.

This is the only brand of dog food he's eaten without making a fussy face. I'm sold!<br /><br />We had him on Royal Canin for about 2 months until we came across Bil Jac. Originally, it was a freebie from our pet supply store. I put it right next to his Royal Canin and the answer was obvious. He loved it. And why wouldn't he? It's made of real chicken and chicken organs, which provides a natural source of fat.<br /><br />I went through the ingredient list and did my own research. Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. I went a bit further and asked my vet. He told me that puppies less than 1 year old are unable to create arginine internally, and although it's not an essential amino acid, it's always a good idea to include it in a puppy's nutrition.<br /><br />Bil Jac is slow cooked for over 40 minutes, and that ensures more nutrients are retained during the process. And the fact that there's no sprayed-on fat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten meal, or less expensive proteins sold me.<br /><br />My vet approved. My budged approved. Most importantly, my puppy gave it the paws up. I'm sticking with Bil Jac all throughout his adult years!"

My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back."

This food requires no transition time, so I immediately switched her to Bil Jac and she has had no digestive problems at all.  I have had to start measuring out her food because she'd eat way more than she needs if I let her.  She is only 4lbs at 8 months old, and the small breed puppy food is very easy for her to chew.

It's a LOT like regular Kraft MnC. It's been made with pasta with 50% whole grain.  Okay, nice compromise there; the 100% whole wheat pastas can be a bit grainy tasting but we know we all need less white flour in our diets.<br /><br />Now, you're discerning 5 year old will probably be able to tell the difference between this and regular Kraft MnC and if he or she is uber-picky about change, demands a certain brand, etc, well, then, this won't fool him.  But my kids ate it up fine.  The 9 year old barely noticed anything different (but she likes WW pastas), the 7 yo who normally doesn't like WW MnC ate it, although could tell it was WW.  The 2.5 year old just kept shoveling it in with his bare hands; I guess that means he liked it.<br /><br />So in a nutshell, this is a worthwhile product to try if you're kids like Kraft MnC.  Same flavor as far as the sauce goes at least.  Same shape of noodles.  The fiber content for a serving of this is a respectable 5g, up from 1g for the tradtional stuff.  Not bad.<br /><br />Of note is the fact that this product has only 6oz in a box as opposed to the 7.25oz in the traditional MnC.<br /><br />For comparison's sake, I usually buy the Hogson Mill 100% WW Mac-n-Cheese.  I found this a bit milder tasting as far as wheaty-ness goes; makes sense as Kraft uses a blend and HM is 100% whole wheat.  My picky eater will eat the Kraft but not the HM.

The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan ""all the time"", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it."

So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans).

I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues."

Over the decades I had not used it, until I recently bought several boxes on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The cocoa powder is excellent and makes a delicious and easy-to-make hot chocolate drink.  But I was very disappointed with the packaging.  The powder was in a box without a bag or a sealed lid.  Consequently it leaked and it was a mess.  I gave one box as a gift and had to seal it in a sealed small freezer bag before gift wrapping it.<br /><br />Droste could do better on the packaging.  Hershey does.<br /><br />I rate the cocoa powder 5 stars and I rate the packaging 1 star.  Therefore and overall, I rate Droste's Dutch Processed Cocoa 3 stars.<br /><br />Steve Riehle"

I think I can hear an inner voice of my mother telling me 60 years ago that I shouldn't like prepared foods, but I ignore that voice a lot. These are extremely easy to make (I heat my water for four minutes in an 1100 watt microwave), and they taste pretty good just as they are.<br /><br />Of course, I rarely leave things just as they are. I sometimes add in some milk with my water. It gives the potatoes a richer taste. I also dice various versions of Spam, mix in some canned string beans and pitted black olives, heat everything up, and mix it in with the potatoes. That way it becomes a quick and easy entree.<br /><br />I suppose homemade mashed potatoes have their points. Just try making them when you're over 60. This product starts looking pretty attractive at that point. And the texture is actually better than the best homemade potatoes I've had (most homemade versions usually just end up lumpy, though).<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend these.

To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.

However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six-inch tall pill bottle with the 1/2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it --i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1/4""H x 6 1/2""W x 1 1/2"" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1/2"" inch long) foil packet is just under 3"" long, less than 1/2"" wide, & 3/8"" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat-poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.<br /><br />Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed-ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.<br /><br />In a (presumably) unconscious self-satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says ""Still Hungry?""

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.

The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan ""all the time"", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it."

So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store.

I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues."

As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands.

I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands.

Looking for a bit more value, I decided to try Cosmic Catnip.  I don't typically like to change a good thing but went with it. I have house cats and also care for some free-roaming cats. Both populations react favorably to the product. For the house cats, I sprinkle some in their cat beds and on their toys and they roll around, sometimes head over heels. It is quite amusing to watch. However, I think the cats are more interested in the Kong product; they seem to spend greater periods of time playing with it and sniffing it.  In my house, that means more exercise and that is something I like to promote.<br /><br />Cosmic's catnip is packaged in a #3 plastic container, which is not as easily recyclable as a #1 or #2 plastic in most areas. The product's packaging also indicates that it is grown in North America, so that may mean outside of the United States. (For the record, Kong's catnip comes in a #1 PETE container that is easily recyclable and its catnip is also grown in North America).<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?  My cats like it but there is no reason to use a container that is only sometimes recyclable for catnip.  Additionally, my cats liked the Kong product a bit more.

Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper, the cats go directly to their toy and try to claw off the paper to start playing with it. The toy entices them for about a week, which afterwards the smell of the catnip starts to vanish. If I accidently leave the lid of the container off, I'll find the jar tipped over and two kitties eating up the leaves and rolling their faces in it.<br /><br />The only down side of this nip, being sold in such bulk and so pure, is it has ""stem-like"" pieces in the container, which can poke through fabric when making toys for the cats. I try to pull out all the stems before filling the toys up with the nip or letting the cats nibble on the product raw. The cats don't seem to mind, however, and there have never been any incidents where the stem gets stuck in their mouth (you know, like when we eat popcorn and the kernel always gets jammed in our mouths).<br /><br />Bottom line: Some powerful nip, the most potent of any nip I've ever bought and will continue to buy it every year."

Well, not real salami anyway. That processed flavor added pre-sliced stuff that taste horrible, is even hard to find. We ordered this since we couldn't find a way to order what we usually got back in California, on line. While not quite the same flavor as we were accustomed to, it is still really good salami. It has a bit of a nutty flavor unlike our old usual salami. The pepper in it isn't as uniformly distributed in some of the chubs, some bites will have a stronger pepper flavor than others, but not too strong to make them any less delicious. Unfortunately, the cooling packs that were in the box broke and water logged everything in it. This seems to make the casing with the mold on it hard to remove--I would suggest overnight shipping if you plan on ordering, to avoid this. Five pounds of salami came to 15 little 7 and a half inch chubs, with a refrigerator life of about 2 to 3 months. This is a bit much for two people to eat; unless you eat salami like my wife and I do. This amount would be perfect for a party of 8 to 12 people if that is what you are looking for. Just make sure to slice them thin. If you are one of those unfortunate people who have never had a chub of salami, only the pre-sliced packaged stuff, you really should try this. It's like the difference between good cheese and processed cheese food. While both serve a purpose, only one is edible by itself. Add a bit of provolone and a club cracker and this salami is heaven in every bite!!"

At first I thought the white on the outside was some sort of wrapping, but upon squinting I noticed that it looked like a residue.<br />""Hm. This is weird"", I thought. Maybe I'll eat it. Sorta like when you find strange crumbs on your kitchen table and stick it in your mouth when no one's looking.<br />So I bought a link, and read the information about Columbus Salame Secchi. Lo and behold, it's actually a sort of mold that grew on the outside of meat! Well I had already bought the thing, and figure I might as well eat it, strange as it may be.<br /><br />I was back at Trader Joe's the next day.<br />They had ONE left. My entire week was ruined!<br />So I did the only thing I could do. Buy it on Amazon!!!!!<br />The package of 12 links came two days ago. Went to the nearby hippie grocery store, bought some Cabernet, Stilton cheese, and imported Italian olives.<br />Wow...<br /><br />The flavor on this meat is just... irresistible. I know when people say something is irresistible, they mean it's really, really good. I actually mean this thing is impossible to resist. I always start eating a link with the intention of just having maybe a third or a half of a link, not because I'm a health nut or something, but just because I don't want to pig out on just some salami. This isn't just salami. This is Salame Secchi. Before I know it, I've eaten the whole darn link of sausage, and I'm feeling guilty not because I've eaten the entire thing, but because I have one fewer link left to eat later.<br /><br />The meat, mold, and fat in the salame come together in a joyful union taste-bud heaven. There's nothing else quite like it. I've always been a fan of salami and prosciutto, but you NEED to try this. If you've ever been a fan of smoked salmon, sashimi, or any kind of meat period, I think it will be impossible to turn this down.<br /><br />I'm ordering another 12 links ASAP."

First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close.

Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer)."

It isn't too tough, is a bit moist, and has a nice flavor. It is much softer than Tofuky Jerky beef jerky replacement, so the texture is easier to deal with, but this flavor is more sweet than the spicy Tofuky Jerky version. I'm excited to taste other flavors to see if there is something a bit on the spicy barbecue side rather than sweet barbecue side, but in general, I really like this and it might convince even the most skeptical meat eater. My dad even liked it, which is saying a lot - he is an old school eater who was very skeptical of anything vegetarian."

I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky."

These are darned tasty to a meat-lover like myself.  Not just these, but the entire line (that I've tried so far).<br /><br />No, you're not likely to be fooled into thinking it once had parents.  The texture of seitan is not all that meat-like, despite what the vegans say (what do THEY know about it, anyway?!).  However, it does have a satisfying chew, and unlike real jerky, you could actually eat a couple Primal Strips products and still have some jaw muscle left.  Also unlike real jerky, these are moist.  Because it's not dehydrated flesh, they're able to have moisture in the flavoring.

My sister used to buy me these at the end of a long day teaching middle schoolers and even on those days when I had skipped lunch (and breakfast) these snacks were very satisfying and so delicious that I was always happy to eat them.  Some of them are made from soy and some are made from seitan which is somewhat more chewy and stringy a food.  My preference is for seitan but surprisingly the soy was also very chewy and certainly very good.  I'm really glad the hikers who founded Primal Spirit went ahead with developing this product and I agree with them wholeheartedly that the meat-alternative foods outside the United States are generally much better and more varied and their product has benefited from that history of good vegetarian food in Asia.

As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward."

The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.

I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.

I know every vegan/vegetarian says this, but even my carnivorous brother liked it. He's the crazy outdoors type though- savage all the way, carving things out of wood, building shelters in the woods, survival stuff. So I trust his meat-comparison ratings. Most veggie people, when it comes to fake meat, tend to say ""it's all about the sauce"". While this is true, this also has the texture. It's more of the soft slim-jim texture I remember (though we can argue- is that really meat? hah)- moist and moderately chewy. I'm curious if sticking these in a dehydrator will make them more jerky like. Anyway I like the mesquite lime. It's not too sweet, tangy and just delicious. I recommend!"

The consistency was a tad grainy where it should have a smooth texture.

The Rum and Raisin was ok, but the raisins had no flavor. The apple and cinnamon didn't taste like apple or cinnamon nor did the strawberry and cream taste like strawberries.

Immediately I started experimenting and making them at home.  I have bought a variety of brands from Asian markets to Whole Foods and they are decent, but I've always been a bit bothered by the fact that they are made from white rice which is not nearly as nutritious as brown rice.  I did not think brown rice wrappers existed!<br /><br />Once again Amazon comes through for the consumer and gives us access to great products like these superior spring roll wrappers!  I didn't think they'd actually taste much different or better than the white rice wrappers I usually buy, but I was SO wrong.  These wrappers are delicious--they taste fresher, are not gummy or thick like the white rice wrappers (my husband LOVES them and whenever we make spring rolls for friends, they rave about them).  Also, the ingredients are superior--they are made from premium whole brown rice, unlike the white rice wrappers which are made from ""white rice flour"" which makes a big difference on so many levels--taste to nutrition.<br /><br />I also read about this company which was started by two women.  They are a small company; they are ethical and care about the quality of their products and farmers that they deal with...unusual in this day and age.<br /><br />One more thing!  Don't be afraid to make these at home!  You can fill these wrappers with anything!  Simply dip the wrap in a bowl of water for a few seconds,  lay it on a table and fill!  I dip 2 wrappers in water at a time (much faster) and spoon in everything from chopped veggies and tempeh to noodles and tofu.  They are simply delicious."

We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try. I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig. Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book.

It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse.

Most others use potassium which is a poor substitute, or various herbs and spices to make up for the missing salt. They add flavors to be sure, but still no salt-like kick of flavor enhancement. It's too bad Amazon doesn't also sell the 1 pound package, that has to be obtained from the small manufacturer, which right now is extremely backlogged. Took me 4 months to get my direct order of the 1 pound package, but a great price saving for everyday use. If it is hard giving up salt, try Table Tasty, I think you will like it."

Those things don't taste like salt at all; they have a slight ""bite"" on the tongue like a spoonful of salt does, but that's about it. If you dissolve them in water, they has little or no flavor at all, and what flavor they do have is nothing like sodium chloride.<br /><br />This stuff, on the other hand, is the real deal. It doesn't rely on potassium chloride, nor on only ""herbs and spices"" as other substitutes like Mrs. Dash or the (in)famous Costo seasoning does/do. Instead, it relies on a combination of herbs, spices, and nutritional/brewer's yeast.

One could swear there is salt in it but, NO, NO, NO!  It is COMPLETELY SALT FREE and also potassium chloride free (potassium chloride has an odd after taste and does not give you that zing you get from salt, so you wined up using a lot more).

I gave away all but about half a pound of them.<br /><br />I still have about half of what I kept, which have been stored in a heavy ziplock bag.

Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."

When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!"

Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem?

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard."

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them.

I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.

I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.

Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."

Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"

From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.

Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine.

I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you."

In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag."

Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat.

Before: I did not think I liked instant coffee. Now: I think I do! :-)<br /><br />I've tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TSS"">International Coffee</a> type products, which are powdered drink mixes and not truly instant coffee, and I was never very impressed. Eventually, I learned (and you'll laugh at me for not knowing this) that instant coffee is not a ""mix"" like hot chocolate but actually coffee beans treated differently in their production from coffee beans intended to be brewed. The bean is roasted as usual, then crushed (rather than cut as for brewing beans) in preparation for creating a coffee ""concentrate"" that will then be either freeze dried or spray dried. This product (as explained on the Nescafe website) is Robusta and Arabica beans, freeze dried, a method which may or may not be the top choice for connoisseurs of instant coffee, but being new to instant coffee I don't yet appreciate the difference.<br /><br />I do know that the product in these single-serving sticks is the same product that was sold in canisters, before. This is just a new format for their current product, not a new product. And wow, for the sheer pleasure and convenience, it's a decent cup of coffee! It can't be mistaken for richly brewed coffee from a restaurant or from your home coffee machine, not even if you douse it with cream, but instead I compare it to ""office"" coffee, or 'cafe au cube farm', which it definitely matches in taste and quality. Easy, quick, mellow. Great idea when I'm the only soul who wants a cup of coffee and can't bear to brew just one or two lonely cups.<br /><br />The big disadvantage of instant coffee, as far as I'm concerned, is that a serving of this product has only abut 65mg of caffeine compared to 45-180mg of caffeine in a brewed cup of coffee (we're talking in the upper end the way I brew mine!). I want my caffeine! The flavored versions of this product have even less caffeine per serving (at 25-30mg) although I couldn't tell you why. (This information, by the way, comes from the Nescafe website FAQ.) The other disadvantage, I suppose, is that the whole house doesn't fill with the sound and fragrance of brewing coffee when I choose to go instant. Alas.<br /><br />Still, given the convenience and the decency of the beverage itself, I'm now buying these little ""single sticks"" pretty regularly! Recommended. :-)"

When fat is reduced, the desired flavor profile requires more spices, but makes cooking more difficult.<br /><br />The texture is closer to hard (than soft) salami.  The fat content appears much less than bologna or spam lite.  Spam does have hints of ham flavor after slow frying; not discerned in (this brand of) pork roll.

Thought that it would be interesting to try since it was powdered and didn't require any brewing. Simply pour into a glass and add water. Could it really be that good if so simple?<br /><br />A resounding YES. I was very surprised. I've been drinking green tea for awhile, so I can see where some may not like the taste at first. But as you continue it grows on you quickly. I tend to like my tea on the stronger side, so the next glass may use 2 packets instead of 1 and slightly more water. Other avid tea drinkers may consider the same.<br /><br />Overall, a great product. Can't wait to try it in a milkshake. :D"

Or, you could say it tastes like a stick of strawberry flavored chapstick melted in your mouth. How can gum taste like wax, you might ask? Well, somehow, it has this weird mouth-coating artificiality that almost exactly recreates the Strawberry Shortcake experience. In this, I am of course referring to the Strawberry Shortcake cartoon that my sister used to watch when we were 9 years old.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this gum, chewing it and imagining myself tearing the strawberry-scented hair from an undeserving brat's sacchirine cheerful little plastic doll, defying the little monster to attempt to stop me. It was a fantastic experience of um, fantasy.<br />I gave some to a coworker, and she loved it, too (but she has pica), and preferred it over the drywall she had been eating for lunch. Apparently, it's also 5 calories, which makes it slightly more fattening than that same wallboard, but less fattening than the chapstick she ate yesterday.<br />If you're on a diet, and have pica, and love Strawberry Shortcake, then this is your new favorite gum.

It is also wonderful poured into a more sophisticated goblet, the flavor is alluring and can almost be called pretentious when properly served in place of a dessert liquor or wine spritzer.

That was a far, far better way to obtain a cool drink. At least in Vienne France if gave the nice inn keeper a twenty I got free use of a tiny fridge, which he found remarkably strange to use for my juice, colas or water. But that's off topic.<br /><br />Here's what you get for the almost four dollars per bottle, a weak watered slightly sweet beverage with a cross of what I hold is a mandarin and orange pulp, minor amount of pulp, some rather dingy looking stuff that's settled in the bottom that's grainy and a lot of off carbonated water. It's what my husband calls (poor word) water, but he likes them. For him they fill a sentimental niche. For me they say....France was very expensive.<br /><br />But I adored much about the travel and the country. I do like the bottles. I save them, peel off the labels and use them for rosemary in oil and other kinds of herbed oils I like to make. So if he'll drink it up, or I can pawn it off on some unaware visitor then I've got a nice bottle to use making bath oils.

Coconut sugar is supposed to be less calories and have a lower glycemic level compared to cane sugar.  As I understand glycemic levels, the lower the level, the easier it is for your body to metabolize, thus not creating that ""sugar crash"".<br /><br />To compare to cane sugar, I used a 1:1 ratio as suggested by the company.  I ate it raw on cinnamon toast (blonde), and made pancakes (blonde) and Toll House cookies with it (both blonde and regular).  For the most part I found it to be completely interchangeable with cane sugar in recipes.

Ingredients are: 1 1/8 powdered milk, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 cup coconut sugar, blended to a fine consistency.)  It isn't all that pretty (beige color) but it makes wonderful lemon bars.<br /><br />Coconut sugar doesn't taste exactly like cane sugar (more maple-y and hearty), but there is no sugar crash since it has a low glycemic index of 35 (lower than apples and carrots).  It is loaded with potassium, along with nitrogen, zinc, magnesium and several vitamin Bs (as opposed to agave syrup, which is fairly empty of any nutritional value).<br /><br />Additionally, this price that Amazon offers is less than my co-op's bulk price."

I was pleasantly surprised by the natural sweetness of this sugar. It was not powdery and over sweet like most sugar alternatives. I enjoy baking with my kids and I feel slightly less guilty using this sweetener. It is easy to substitute 1:1 for regular sugar. I started using a teaspoon or two in our breakfast smoothies (which are made with unsweetened protein powder, fruit and unsweetened rice or almond milk) and suddenly the kids were asking for seconds.

I was running low on the 'raw sugar' I bought a few months back, and was looking for some more, when I ran into this.  For the price, it was worth a try.<br /><br />When I opened the package and caught the first sniff of the product, the first thought that came into my head was 'grape nuts'.  Odd, but that's what it made me think of.  The flavor is acceptable, no coconut that I could discern.  I agree that it doesn't seem quite as sweet as regular sugar.  It dissolves well in my coffee, but I haven't tried it on cereal yet.  I like the fact that it provides some nutritional value as well as sweetness.<br /><br />So, my 5 rating is qualified only by the fact that it is less sweet than I am used to.  I'm going to try using the same amount as I would if I were using 'regular' sugar and see if it's something I can get used to.  I could stand to become a little less dependent on sweetness."
26363,B005HGOIQ4,A2DCICB9VI8I4E,CapeCodLady,2,2,5,1346976000,Good stuff!,I use this in both my coffee and my tea now in place of refined sugar after seeing it on the Dr Oz show. It tastes great and doesn't mess with my blood sugar. I plan to try the cookie recipe posted here on Amazon at Christmas time. It is pricier than sugar but it's money well spent to me. I've tried every kind of sugar substitute out there on the market and I found they all left an aftertaste I didn't like. Not so with the coconut sugar. Delicious!
26364,B005HGOIQ4,A1CA8OBL555NG0,momma chic,2,2,5,1346198400,Most nutritious and best performing alternative sugar,"I have been using Madhava coconut sugar for 6 months now, and have used it extensively in nearly every application where cane sugar is normally used.  Previously, I have used succanat sugar, raw honey, and agave sugars as well as non-sugar sweeteners such as xylitol and stevia.  Of all of the sugars, this compares most favorably to cane sugar in terms of taste and performance.  As a bonus, it has the most vitamins, minerals, and trace nutrients of any sugar available.<br /><br />The texture is very dry and lighter coming out of the bag.  The smell and taste is similar to succanat--as is the performance.  It works very well in any coarser baked goods -- muffins, breads, some cookies, and even brownies.  Like unprocessed cane sugars, it will color your baking brown and leave a bit of a gritty texture, so very fine baked goods will not work.  Also in baking, I sometimes add a tad more liquid to make up for the dryness.  For drinks, it dissolves a little slower than regular sugars.  Finally, it is definitely less sweet than cane sugar cup for cup.  To me, this is not a bad thing--I often reduce the sugar a bit in recipes anyway.<br /><br />Of course, we all need to eat less sugar.  This is a GREAT option for those who want a lower glycemic, more nutritious sugar to use in foods they are going to eat anyway.  Amazon has the best price anywhere on this, and I will keep buying as long as it is available."

You measure it just like sugar and it is very nice in whole wheat chocolate chip cookies and works just like sugar. I is a pale brown and acts like brown sugar and tastes a little like it also.<br /><br />I am glad to have this safe choice. Is not suppose to spike your blood sugar and I think that is worth adjusting to it's taste.  Amazon has the very best offers for this product of all the places I looked.

They say this stuff is better for you, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Like other folks say, it's a bit less sweet than regular or even raw sugar ... I just add more to taste (hopefully that's not defeating the purpose!)  It does tend to have some dark specs in it, but I know it's part of the refining process.  I got a great deal on Amazon and I'm very happy with this purchase.  I use it in my coffee every day!  Now, I just need to find a 'healthier' substitute for creamer."

The sweetness is rather like a mild brown sugar or a raw sugar and coconut sugar is not highly processed, whereas cane and beet sugar are highly processed.<br /><br />Coconut sugar consists primarily of sucrose which is chemically the same as cane or beet sugar, but it has a small amount of glucose and fructose. Attention, diabetics, it should be dealt with carefully, though it is said to be lower glycemic, with a glycemic index of 35. It is said to be diabetic-friendly, but I'd be sure to test it out and measure blood sugar levels, to make sure how your system reacts to this sweetener. (I am not diabetic, but I am always chary of any new sweetener that claims to be low glycemic or better for diabetics as each person can have quite different reactions.)<br /><br />In any case, this has more minerals, less processing and tastes great. It's a really great substitute for raw sugar or evaporated cane juice and excellent especially for Asian cooking. I like jaggery sugar (date palm sugar) but as it comes in an unwieldy lump that needs grating, this granulated coconut sugar is a good substitute when making certain chutneys and other curries."

She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago.

As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick."

Its chew is ideal for a tender jerky, it's not overly softened by enzymes to the point of crumbling, yet still retains a bit of a chew so feels like actual jerky. All of the pieces are nicely trimmed and cut against the grain from good quality beef.<br /><br />The flavor is very nice as well, there's a distinct garlic flavor and a solid spicy taste. It's definitely not extremely spicy though, if you aren't phased by Tabasco sauce then this jerky will not be very hot to you. For me, the saltiness of this jerky is considerably more intense than the spiciness. My mouth remains parched many minutes after eating this, so be prepared to drink a lot of water since it's salt content is considerably higher than the average jerky.<br /><br />The saltiness didn't overwhelm too much though so I was still able to experience the really nice flavor and consistency of the meat.  A lot of jerky companies use papaya enzymes to tenderize their jerky, but it tends to make it artificially soft and crumbly, sticky even. Buffalo Bill's does not use these enzymes which I assume is why they are pretty heavy on the salt since it's such a good tenderizer. if they were able to lower the salt and retain the same constancy than this would without a doubt be 5-star perfect jerky.<br /><br />This is still very good stuff though and if you are not too bothered by high salt foods and like a little spice then you should definitely give this a try."

Indeed, the delicacy is so extraordinary that Mark Twain named his most famous character after it. And why not? People who know about wild Huckleberries tend to be very passionate about them. Evocative of summer sunlight, mountainsides, mysterious woods, and images of children berry hunting. The huckleberry bushes' small oval leaves, the blue-black berries, perfectly round, each with an intense flavor, a unique tartness and crunch.<br /><br />This uncultivated cousin of the blueberry, grows only in the wild at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. Twelve species of huckleberries are native to Washington and Oregon. They also grow wild in the Rocky Mountains. However varied the berry, the season is short: late July through mid-September. Because they are hard to find, they tend to be expensive. But huckleberry lovers swoon over the thick skin and wild flavor that no other berry captures as well. As far as I am concerned, these berries, food of the god's, are worth every penny.<br /><br />Huckleberry Haven's Wild Huckleberry Jam perfectly captures the pure, natural taste of this most elite of berries. Buy one jar and you will be back to buy an entire case. I spread the jam on toast, muffins, scones, French Toast, occasionally even on pancakes - much better than syrup, and as another reviewer wrote, this is the best jam to accompany peanut butter.

As we were expermenting with variety of solid food, we weren't sure what was giving him diarrhea.  We removed almost everything from his diet over the course of that week, until we were left with this cereal and his formula.  Only then, it dawned on me that it could be this cereal, again, with which he didn't have any problem before.  As I read some reviews only at that point, some parents had pointed out these were rancid, and I could confirm my can smelled bad as well.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon would not accept returns on these products.  The trouble we went through warrants more than a refund - my baby developed a severe diaper rash due to constant bowl movement, and we ended up seeing a pediatrian to get a prescription for his open-blistered bottom.

This does not constipate him either and I love that it is Organic and enriched with Probiotcs and DHA.<br />If you are looking for a great first food for your baby with quality ingredients this is it and you can't beat the price for organic.

Our girl likes their stuff--she's more partial to the rice cereal--and we like that it's organic and (fairly) unadulterated.  Addition of DHA and probiotics a plus.  If you can, try to find a sample portion or individual can for your child before committing to a large, 6-canister purchase, like this one.  Btw, it's tasty enough that Mommy and Papa don't mind getting this cereal in their mouths when cajoling their stubborn baby to eat."

I couldn't find organic at our local supermarket so I tried this brand online and they didn't care for the taste (we managed to choke it down with smaller amounts mixed in), but I then found organic gerber which they love!  I can mix the gerber with a little juice and water and they love it.  I would not purchase this brand of oatmeal or cereal again.  The only thing good about it is that it is organic."
26560,B000YSS7EO,A94KSN8S21FI9,BlackEyedEd,0,0,1,1293062400,Poor Quality Product - Recall should be issued!,"After doing a lot of research on single grain oatmeal cereal, it's clear HappyBellies has the best ingredients (DHA from algea as opposed to fish oil and a better blend of probiotics as opposed to just one type). However, there definitely is some sort of production problem with the cans of oatmeal with a July 2012 expiration date.<br /><br />First, there is a distinct smell with this oatmeal. This oatmeal has a strong stale smell and looks grey in color. All other oatmeals have almost no smell at all and have a consistent light-khaki color.<br /><br />Second, the HappyBellies oatmeal does not thicken formula as other oatmeals do. Our son has acid reflux and we were told to add one tablespoon of oatmeal per ounce of formula. When I use Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, this makes the formula very thick - sludgelike. With the HappyBellies, no matter how much I add it doesn't thicken the formula at all. It remains watery and not suitable for a baby who spits up excessively.<br /><br />Third, I think our son has an allergic reaction to this oatmeal. He has no issue using the non-organic Gerber oatmeal with DHA and probiotics, but with the HappyBellies he has thrown up the formula/oatmeal immediately after eating it as if his stomach was upset. He also seemed to break out in a rash after putting him on HappyBellies after a couple of days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviews that there definitely seems to be something wrong with this batch of oatmeal. I suspect that moisture somehow go into the oatmeal before it was sealed and as a result it rotted in the can, thus causing a bad smell, a grey color, and unable to absorb the moisture from the formula to thicken the solution. The grey color has even made me wonder if it's mold that has grown on the oatmeal.<br /><br />It's very clear to me that HappyBellies should issue a voluntary recall of this product!"
26561,B000YSS7EO,AB0CU2DSL7XWU,J. L. Perez,0,0,5,1286496000,Read the Amazing List of Ingredients!,"I showed this to my son's pediatrician and he was impressed with (and supported!) the list of items added to the cereal!<br /><br />This was the first solids I added to my child's bottle when we started to transition away from milk only. The cereal is really finely milled and melts away easily into the liquid. At first I was worried that it would thicken up too much that it would clog the milk from flowing through, but happy to report it did not happen. I usually add one tablespoon of cereal to 6oz of milk. I noticed that once I started to do that, the bottle will sustain my son for longer periods of time especially at night. Now, I use this with every bottle of milk I make for him. Sometimes I also use this to thicken some of the fruits or veggie puree that are too watery. This makes the puree thicker and easier for baby to eat from the spoon. When the puree is too thin, it will dribble out of baby's mouth easily - after all they are just starting to get the hang of gumming,tasting and swallowing something this is not completely liquid.<br /><br />Amazon prices are much cheaper ($19.29 for pack of 6 or $3.22 per canister) compared to what the local Whole Foods would charge(about $5 including tax for ONE). I hesitated for a moment since this is after all SIX canisters, but after looking at how much I use this on a daily basis, I am sure we will deplete this in no time!"

It's nice to make the transition and have it included in his food at this price point.<br /><br />When I first tried the cereal, I made a small amount (1 tsp cereal and 4 tsp breast milk) and made it runny (easy to do, as there is nothing glue-like about this cereal). He wasn't too fond of the experience - but that's not a reflection on this product at all. He's 5 months old now so I mix 1 tablespoon of the powder with 1 oz of breast milk and drop in one cube of frozen veggies (I make my own food and freeze it in ice cube trays). I heat it all up, mix it well and he's in HEAVEN! He prefers carrots & cereal, and butternut squash & cereal... and his favorite is bananas & rice cereal. I've tasted them all and while it's more bland than I had imagined, it's tasty. It's not sweet, just like a mellow oatmeal. This cereal also retains it's consistency throughout the feeding and also holds onto its warmth - which is great for a son like mine who will only eat warm/hot food!<br /><br />Also, there's been no constipation/diarrhea side effects like most first foods will have on your baby - a welcomed relief!"

They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.<br /><br />""I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more browning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a ""positive release"" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...<br />Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours/colours/odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son.""<br /><br />I believe in this product and their commitment to customers.

It didn't have nearly as much flavor, and the flavor it did have wasn't much like lemonade to me.  But the ingredients were still pretty good, and that's really what makes this brand stand out from the others.<br /><br />True Lemon products boast that they have 100% natural ingredients.  And its true, they do.  They use stevia instead of artificial sweeteners and actual lemon oil and juice for the flavoring.  This makes me think at least that what I'm drinking is healthy.  There's even some turmeric for color in here and that's actually a beneficial spice.  So all in all, a good product on the market.  A lot healthier than some of the other drink additives out there.<br /><br />The taste, not as good in this one.  Its not terrible, like some of the water additives I've tried, but it tastes extremely weak.  That and the pale yellow color the water turns it just isn't appetizing.  Its still got a sweet taste, but the tanginess of the lemon isn't really there and it more just tastes like sugar water.  I would say their estimate on the amount of flavoring per water ratio may be off and perhaps two packets would be a better choice for the water.  It may be something I have to try.<br /><br />I probably won't buy this particular flavor from True Lemon again, but it won't stop me from trying some of their other products.

26753,B004XG2H6W,A1OMYB84GJJHCD,reallynow,1,1,4,1340928000,A Great Alternative,"First things first: if you've been drinking powdered drink mixes flavored with aspartame or similar chemicals, True Lemonade will probably take a bit of getting used to.  These days, everything is ridiculously over-sweetened, and our taste buds have become accustomed to it.  Now that I've been drinking True Lemonade for years, I don't know how I ever drank the other stuff.  It's all sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />True Lemonade is milder but perfectly palatable.  It won't replace fresh-squeezed lemonade or anything of that sort, but when it comes to naturally flavored, low calorie drink mixes, it's the best game in town.  I can't stand plain water, and this jazzes it up very nicely.  The flavor isn't watery or over-sweetened (and I actually use the packets meant for 16 oz in my 25 oz water bottle, so I get a much milder flavor than most people do).<br /><br />My only complaints might not apply to everyone, since they have to do with the packaging.  I wish True Lemon offered a container of just powder, sans the packets, since I don't use it on the go, and the packets just create extra waste.  I also recommend ordering from Amazon, because the official True Lemon store likes to send outrageous amounts of plastic packing peanuts along with the order, which shows a real lack of environmental awareness.  Amazon's packaging is much less wasteful."

This product is sweetened with Stevia, a natural but low calorie sweetener which to me, tastes a bit like saccharine, including the aftertaste.<br /><br />When you mix this powder with 16 ounces of cold water, you are not going to mistake the result for actual lemonade. It is much weaker, and has the stevia flavor. However, its not bad either, and the calorie savings makes it a serious alternative when you have a lemonade craving. We find that if we add a few drops of RealLemon juice to the mixture, it blunts the stevia taste somewhat. We'll be drinking a lot of this throughout the summer."

Bolwahn,1,1,5,1320364800,Absolutely fantastic - wouldn't use another litter,"Interesting to read the other reviews - especially the ones that comment about the bugs.  We've been using Swheat Scoop since we adopted our cat in May of 2010 and haven't had a single problem with it.  There is only one local retailer that carries it and only in box form.  Maybe the bags can be infiltrated more easily by the bugs? Maybe it's the timing of maufacture and the environmental conditions at the factory or warehouse, and maybe its the location of the end-use litterbox and environmental conditions of the space? Or any combination of aforementioned possibilities... or I'm way off. Regarless, observations noted and I will look for problems in future batches - I'll make sure to add bay leaves as noted by another reviewer.<br /><br />I certainly won't plan on changing anytime soon, however, even with the chance of bugs.  This stuff is wonderful.  Grew up with cats and volunteered at a shelter. Will never buy clay again - the dust is awful and the fragrance even worse.  After several years of keeping their cat's box in a storage room, my parents found there was a layer of light, perfumy dust on EVERYTHING when they pulled the boxes and began sorting items for a rummage sale. Just think about that getting circulated around the house! They did try another natural litter after my experience with Swheat Scoop and ended up switching a short time later to this brand and are very glad they did. It only sticks to the bottom when the level starts to get low - so I add more and its fine again.  I try to scoop something every other day - may be a few days in between if life gets busy, but there is still not that much odor. It clumps nicely; however, I try to scoop when I know my cat hasn't used the box in a while just to make sure that the clumps have time to set up. Never had a problem otherwise. Flushing can sometimes be a problem if I get impatient and overload the bowl and then fail to let it soak and soften for a few minutes. But this particular toilet has issues, too.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Love this stuff, so do my parents; we'd recommend to anyone."

I have one cat (that uses a litter box, the other uses the tub and had for years before I got her.)  Not only does it control odors very well (I don't add anything to it to help) but it clumps nicely for scooping. The best parts are that I don't get a face full of choking clay dust when I change the litter and it is flushable! My second litter box is a Cat Genie (which I also love) so I only have to clean the upstairs box every 3 to 5 days (at the first whiff of an odor) but I just flush it away (it takes about 5 flushes for one whole litter box worth because you have to do it in small increments.)

I came a bit late to the natural litter party, because I was afraid natural litters would clump poorly/smell bad etc. Swheat Scoop is the second natural litter I've tried, and I had planned to try them all but this stuff is so great that I've decided there's no need to look further.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a cat litter that never smells bad, has no dust, never tracks at all, and produces clumps so perfect that they neither stick to the side/bottom of the box nor crumble apart a bit. That said, Swheat Scoop is the closest to perfect I've ever found, in ALL of these respects.<br /><br />Smell: Slightly ""barnyard""-like (it is wheat, after all), but I only notice it when I'm scooping out the box; if you scoop daily, you will not have an ambient smell. (We live in a 1-BR condo and the litter box is in the bathroom, so I would notice if there was a lingering smell.)<br /><br />Dust: Hands down, the least dusty litter (clay or natural) I've ever tried.<br /><br />Tracking: Minimal, on par with the lowest-tracking clay litters I've used, and superior to the lightweight (pine/cedar) natural litters. Swheat Scoop's consistency is quite like Grape Nuts cereal (sorry to gross out anyone who eats Grape Nuts), so because the granules are on the heavier side they tend not to track.<br /><br />Clumps: Not perfectly tight, but they can be scooped easily enough. With a high volume of urine, the clumps do stick to the bottom/sides a bit, but in my experience the tighter-clumping clay litters adhere MUCH more to the bottom and sides. (One of our cats pees a ton and the side-sticking drove me nuts with clay litter.) And as another reviewer mentioned, keeping the litter level high enough definitely mitigates this problem.<br /><br />I haven't experienced the bug problem others mentioned, but I'm willing to risk it considering how great this stuff is."

And some of the leaves were torn, but none were falling apart and I had no trouble getting them out of the can intact.  They were wrapped very tightly.  The directions say to drain the oil, and that's good advice.  They tasted even better after doing that and refrigerating them.  They have a lemony taste, but not too strong.  Couldn't even taste the mint.  They use sunflower oil, which I don't think is as good as olive oil, but most of the canned stuffed grape leaves seem to do the same, probably because it's cheaper.  The recipe I prefer has a lot of dill and onions and lemon and uses extra-virgin olive oil (a Greek recipe), and the Roland  has no dill.  But for the price I thought these were definitely worth buying.  I certainly won't have a problem eating them in a few days.  I've never frozen grape leaves before, but I don't see why it couldn't be done.  I doubt these are the best canned stuffed grape leaves out there (the Al-Wadi and Divina have better ratings), but they are good enough for me, especially for the price.  And they are vegetarian."

The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S"">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.

Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.""

Bad move. When introducing a new food, one should add a small amount of the new to the old and then gradually increase the percentage of new food in the mix until you reach 100% of the new stuff. Not surprisingly Bella got a bout of runny stools after this rude introduction to Just a Wee Bit.<br /><br />Within a week, however, Bella had adjusted to her new food and seems to be doing well on this new diet. I haven't smelled her stools to see if they are less odiferous and have no intentions of conducting such a test. As an added test, I put less than an tablespoon of the Solid Gold kibble on the plates of Evie and Piper. They actually seemed to like this new food quite a bit, even the ever-fussy Piper.<br /><br />Just a Wee Bit is the smallest dog kibble I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few brands. Ever look at the little paper circles inside a whole puncher? Individual pieces of this kibble are almost as big as those paper cut outs and about as thick as a nickel. Be careful pouring this food because it's easy to drop a few pieces and almost impossible to find them. You'll have to rely on your dog's sense of smell to recover any dropped kibble. Occasionally Bella gets bits of this micro kibble caught in her throat making us think the tiny size of the pieces is too extreme.<br /><br />Finally-  I must admit that, based on the inclusion of wholesome ingredients and the exclusion of junk, this is an excellent dog food. Most dogs should thrive on such a recipe. One on a budget will probably prefer to find an alternate quality food that isn't so expensive. Since this formula is intended for dogs that have allergic reactions to some common ingredients in other foods, the extra expense really isn't necessary for dogs that have no such allergy problems. For hypersensitive Evie, this is a terrific choice. For dogs that can eat anything, it might be considered extreme."

They made it through last summer and winter without dying and that was about it.  This spring, as everything around was turning green and lush, these little bushes were pretty sad looking and very brittle.  No flowers and brown looking leaves.  In fact, they almost looked like they were dead.  My husband (better known as Eeyore) was sure that they were as good as dead, said that fertilizer would never work, and was getting ready to pull them up and go buy some that were already large and healthy looking--and also very expensive.  I said, hold everything--before we give up, let me look online and see if there is something we can do to save these.<br /><br />I read a review here and some at epinions on Miracid azalea/camellia/rhodedendron food. I then promised him if this didn't work, we could pull up those plants and start over.<br /><br />Thank you to all of you who wrote reviews here and elsewhere.  I want to add my own recommendation.  Because--unbelievably, within two days after feeding, the first flowers were peeking out.  It is now not even a full week later and all 6 bushes have flowers and/or buds.  I counted at least 22 buds on one bush alone.  My nay-saying husband first said that it was a coincidence but now he is talking about feeding them every couple of weeks!!  I think he has become a believer.  Me too--I never did tell him but I really thought those bushes were probably dead, too.<br /><br />Really amazing stuff!"

I also am a devoted lover of geraniums and I like to have them growing in hanging pots. But they will not withstand the winters here, so I winter them over in the greenhouse and bring them out when they are safe from frost. When they come out they always have suffered dieback of some of the branches, sometimes a lot depending on the winter.  So, this year, I decided to try giving them the miracle grow for acid loving plants instead of general purpose miracle grow.  It made a huge difference.  I fed them this several times until the foliage came back, and boy did it come back.  They are much more lush and green and as a result have more branches to produce buds.  After which I switched back to general purpose miracle grow.  I decided to try the same procedure on other plants not previously treated this way, such as roses and it produced the same results.  Then of course I switched back to regular rose food.  I even tried it on my tomatoes right after transplanting them from the greenhouse to the ground.  It gave them a boost during the transition from greenhouse to outdoors, without trying to get them to produce blooms.  It has been a boon to my tomatoes.  They made the transition seamlessly."

This stuff is very open to doctoring and I highly recommend adding at least 12oz of ground beef. Not a huge fan of the rice but I found it to be hardly noticeable. It's a mild chili, so for spice add either cayenne powder or chili powder. About two TBL of cayenne powder whisked in added a nice additional kick for my batch.

Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

I was impressed by the tuna being packed in Olive Oil. The solid tuna was slightly darker than solid white Albacore, but had a good taste and apparently contains less trace mercury than the solid white tuna. When I went back to the ""Mart"", the item was no longer offered, so I turned to Amazon. I ordered two cases of 12 cans per case. When I finally received the cans, I found that the amount of Olive Oil and tuna grade were very inconsistent.<br />Either there was a small amount of oil along with a lot of water or there was very little liquid at all. The can's label does not list water as an ingredient. Some cans had fillets, while others had a mash of small tuna chunks. I probably will not order another case of this brand again."

I read the reviews from some disgruntled (probably overly picky) people who were upset about the consistency of the tuna.  While it may be that you don't always get a solid chunk of tuna or sometimes it's packed a little looser than other times, you still get a whole can of tuna instead of a fourth of a can of flaked tuna and three quarters of water like the regular cans.

Was $1.48 per can at meijers. The olive oil was evoo(extra virgin olive oil), & adds an enhanced flavor to the tuna. The tuna pieces were larger & not all smooshed like I usually find in tuna packed in water. It tends to be a little drier than the stuff in water as well. But I like that. I don't like drippy sandwiches & I always get that from tuna in water. No matter how long I leave the tuna in the mesh strainer. I,just had my sandwich with a light brushing of miracle whip, put the tuna on, topped of with another slice of bread & ate it. Sooo goood!!!!! I do not place the tuna in a bowl & mix with miracle whip because even with lightly folding in the salad dressing it still smooshes the tuna. And I like the bigger pieces.

I shake mine, does a very good job (IMHO) but you have to really shake things up. Works better than a blender, I think.<br /><br />Using lactaid (10 oz) the drink is kind of thick if you use the two scoops recommended which I do,  my wife uses one scoop in 8 oz. Using water or rice milk both have the same consistancy which is much thinner with a loss of some flavor. I prefer the lactaid milk...<br /><br />The powder is very fine and can be packed like moist chalk dust. With that being said packing the scoop makes mixing more difficult, which I believe maybe the source of the lumps.<br /><br />I drink one 10 oz cup in the morning with my vitamins and another after work then a have a smaller helping for dinner. When I first started I would have all kinds of cravings so I started eating more fruit during the day so from that perspective I do eat more little meals through out the day, but I have lost 6 lbs in a month without any excercise.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend at least giving Naturade a try..."

We have this just about every morning in smoothies (1 1/2 scoops, 8-12 frozen strawberries, 1 TBS chocolate cocoa mix, 3 cups milk, 2 bananas).  Although my recipe may not be the healthiest, it tastes great.  I have also tried the French Vanilla Total Soy as well, but we love chocolate too much to switch.<br /><br />Also with respect to the other brand mentioned, I had to use 3x as much cocoa to cover up the after taste.  This Naturade version has a very slight after-taste - probably due to the soy - but it's better than using pure cocoa!<br /><br />Update: All Star Health is very very fast.

I instantly loved it and ended up using the rest of the bottle over the next few weeks!  (Note to self buy a replacement for my buddy!) One to two drops and you will have SUPER minty breath.  I use them at work and people twenty feet away will start saying they smell peppermint :)<br /><br />They can be very strong so start off with one drop and work your way up.  Currently I will use two to three drops on my the back of my hand and then lick it up.  It sounds funny but these are the directions for use.  I believe you can also mix a drop or two with a glass of water and use as mouthwash.  If I eat something like onions or garlic I will use up to four drops, but I love the mint smell and sensation of inhaling the vapors so you're milage may vary.  You can also put a tiny bit uder your nostrils and it will help with sinus issues.<br /><br />As far as any negatives go one I can think of is that after putting the drops on the back of your hand it will leave a white residue behind but it is easily washed off.  Also the price is a bit high in my opinion but a bottle can last about a month and its a good alternative to gum or mints.  Lastly I wish it came in a larger bottle size even just for refilling the small 10oz bottle it comes in.<br /><br />Some people might not like this product.  I have let some co-workers try it and a couple have said its just too strong for them and I have heard one even say he did not like the way it tastes.  Personally for me it's a smell thing and to me it tastes fine, basically like nothing if you take the smell part away.  Some of my friends just think I am weird for putting drops on the back of my hand and licking it off :)<br /><br />I love this stuff and highly recommend it if you want some serious minty breath!<br /><br />Also I think its a natural product with the ingredients being peppermint oil and chlorophyll if that kind of thing is important to you."

Bad idea, he confirmed. The taste was so completely different than when first cooked. Probably could've given myself food poisoning, too.<br /><br />The second and third and fourth time, we grilled the chicken after marinating it overnight. Bad idea. I still had no clue on taste because the charcoal taste overpowered it completely. Waste of marinade.<br /><br />This week, I tried marinating chicken and placed in freezer for 2 weeks. Let thaw and marinate for 2 days in fridge. This time I just baked it. The aroma and flavor was tremendous. My picky 2-year old even loved it. And this time, two days later, it was still super tasty.<br /><br />My only warning is that the packet STINKS when it's first opened. That's not how it tastes, nor how it smells once it is reconstituted with water. That first whiff is just horrible, but the flavor is great.<br /><br />Is it true Korean BBQ?

I'm a very, very good cook and I can tell you that marinating overnight (as they suggest on the package) is not really necessary. A few hours is fine. That said, prepare as directed and the flavor is exactly like the familiar Chinese ribs you get in a restaurant. My only concern is the vibrant red of the marinade. There was a real scare about red dye in foods a few years back and I'm still a little wary of any product that uses dyes (such as red dye #3, used here). I'll probably use what I ordered but I doubt I'll use anymore because of the dye additive. Seriously, why does it have to be red? Why can't it just be great flavor?"

As one other reviewer mentioned, it'd be better (and more honest) if this came in a tub.<br /><br />The taste is fine, but not remarkable in any way. I'm not sure how this product is better than you putting tofu, TSP and spices in a blender and then shaping it like poop.<br /><br />Usually vegan fake meats are at least texturally close, and while they can't approximate meat exactly they are at least trying. Soyrizo makes no attempt (other than the plastic packaging) at being what it claims to replace.<br /><br />It is a pain in the butt to cook as it has no structure at all, and it burns readily. I cooked half at a high temperature like the packaging suggested - it burned quickly! Then I cooked the other half at a low temperature, cut up into smaller poops so I could roll them over. Regardless of how long it was cooked, it did not dry out or become more solid.<br /><br />I was very very disappointed by this Soyrizo and will not buy it again."

I was looking for a good, mild decaf coffee for myself and to offer friends in the evening and that is exactly what I received.<br /><br />Does the picture say ""extra bold""? Yes, but everything else about the product in the description says that it's a ""light roast""...not to mention the scathing 1 star reviews stating that it's not extra bold even though the picture says it is. Take an extra 30 seconds next time and read through the description and maybe some reviews before spending your money. That is a technical error and shouldn't be held against the quality of the actual product in the review.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with the coffee as I do not like dark roasts - so if you are like minded, I believe you will enjoy this coffee, and hey - the price is right, too.  There aren't too many k-cups you can get for around .50/cup."

Some of the other canned lentils we have tried have had larger than expected beans, but these are a much smaller bean. We originally found these at our local Whole Foods, but they were often sold out or in low supply. Needless to say, we were very happy to find that Amazon also stocks these lentils, although they are often in low supply here as well. These lentils make a great substitute for using dried lentils and are awesome for anyone following a Slow Carb diet, such as the diet described by Tim Ferriss in his book Four Hour Body.

It has a very mild tea flavor that is pleasant and not overpowering. Since we already lug tons of bottled water from Costco it is great not to have to also buy bottled drinks. The Crystal Light packets make drinking more water a breeze. Since I started using these packets I keep water in the refrigerator and mix up some tea for when I'm reading or out shopping. I also love to make slushies with this drink mix. Just put a bottle in the freezer for a few hours and then shake vigorously. I will say these ""on the go"" flavors can be a bit addictive.

I was not happy with the flavor or the way it didn't dissolve easily. However this crystal light version is so much better. The flavor is not exactly like the Snapple but it is very pleasant and it dissolves perfectly. I actually use more water to mix it than suggested just to stretch it out a little but it still has a good flavor."

It is just right flavor-wise, which is not the case with some of the other CL flavors.  For example, the raspberry is sooo sweet and pretty unbearable.  But, the tea is a good mix and buying it here is cheaper that at the grocery.  The price keeps going up locally, and now they are up to over $2.50 a box for a pack of 10, which is ridiculous.  You used to be able to get this stuff for about .15 to .19 each.  That may not be a big deal for one pack, but when you drink as much of this as I do (probably 2 boxes a week), it starts to add up.<br /><br />I recommend the Peach Tea.  It's one of the few flavors that CL has not messed with in regards to taste.  It seems they have revamped most of the other flavors, but not this one."

These packets are really convenient. I carry them everywhere. On my pocket, backpack and car. I try to have them everywhere I can to prevent drinking soda. So far so good. These were recommended from my nutritionist. I had a bad soda habit. I would drink way too much soda in one day. She recommended to drink lots of water but if I had an urge to drink something sweet then to drink a crystal light drink. I haven't had a soda for a few months now.

As with their hamburger buns, it is better to refigerate and the microwave for a few seconds to warm them. With regular bread microwaving makes them rubbery but with these it softens them just right. heating over bbq or toasting makes them too dry. also use more condiments than you would with regular buns. All in all the diabetic or low carber can have a hot dog on bun without raising the sugar unduely. Though they are expensive with shipping, it is worth it for your health."

My son has been living in China for the past year and was really lonely for some good old fashion American food for the holidays. Pecan Pie is one of the favorites. We saw this boxed pie and couldn't pass it up! But we were surprised to learn how few ovens there are in China. Most of the food is steamed and fried. The lack of an oven was disappointing and we didn't hear much more until my son told me he had found some friends who had an American style oven and he had cooked the pie for them! It was really a huge hit. I notice this company makes other pies and I think I will send other over. I strongly suggest this 'pie in a box' for anyone who wants to give a special treat!

I've been on a raspberry flavor kick for eons and as with everything else that has many variations and brands representing the same flavor, there are lots of hits and misses. I tried Bigelow's other raspberry (caffeinated)tea as well as a few others and they didn't have the punch that this decaffeinated one has. I add some sugar to a tall 18oz mug for my hot tea and I'm in heaven! Since this is made with ""hibiscus, rose hips, apples, elderberries, natural & artificial raspberry flavors. Gluten free"" might be why it's taste is more pronounced and might upset tea purists, I really don't care. I buy this for the great flavor.

The 8-pound bag used to be $8.69, but is now $16.00 and some change.  Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it."

Have been searching for a dog food that doesn't contain corn and animal by-products that dog food companies like to use as fillers and cheap ingredients. This is definitely the best and most affordable one I found. I have been using it for about a year for my 2year Welsh Corgi and he loves it.
27371,B0040BESXK,A27VBMB8NNKEJU,A. Patterson,2,2,5,1348876800,My dogs really love this dog food,"I recently switched to this dog food from Nature's Variety Prairie.<br /><br />So far I am very pleased with the dog food.  When switching, I was looking for a certain range of protein and fat and Merrick Whole Earth met the requirements I was looking for (a protein reading of 27%, a fat level of 14%) and chicken meal and turkey meal is the main source of animal protein.  The dog food was also ""highly recommended"" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.<br /><br />My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature's Variety, half the time they never ate their breakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.<br /><br />I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.<br /><br />I actually really liked Nature's Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.<br /><br />****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.  I MAY BE WRONG BUT THIS APPEARS MORE OF AN AMAZON INCREASE AS MY BACKUP FOR BUYING THIS DOG FOOD IS PETCO AND THE 8 POUND BAG IS CURRENTLY SELLING FOR $10.42, ABOVE BIT ABOVE THE AMAZON PRICE INCREASE BUT WELL BELOW THE CURRENT $16 FOR AN 8 POUND BAG.

Sadly I will have to seek an alternative now.<br /><br />We have been feeding our 10 month old pug Merrick food shortly after we got him.  He is still considered to be in the puppy stage, but Merrick discontinued Puppy Plate so we decided to start him on adult food a few months early.  I introduced it to him in a 50/50 mix for one weeks and there were no problems transitioning to the new food.  Merrick Whole earth Farms Adult dry dog food is grain based dog food with chicken and turkey being it's main sources of protein.  There are no real taboo ingredients in this mix and has turned out to be a great choice.  Compared to puppy plate his stools are equally firm, but slightly smaller, indicating better digestion.

I use this in a mix with Halo and so far we haven't seen any sign of allergies (which is why we changed to Halo in the first place).

In terms of performance/protein drinks, this ranks very highly compared to the rest of the competition.<br /><br />Packaging: The packaging was a little lacking. The overall design on the can was pretty appealing, however, instead of printing on the can, the printing was on a plastic sheet wrapped around the can. This caused it to interfere with the mouth of the can and plastic was able to work its way inside my mouth.<br /><br />Size: The size was 11 fluid ounces, which seemed a little bit small for a post workout shake, depending on how rigorous your routine is. In general, it is a pretty good compliment to a high protein meal post workout.<br /><br />Nutrition: This product has a very high calorie content compared to what it offers in protein. It has almost 400 calories against only about 20 grams of protein. If you are just starting out and are looking to put on weight quickly, this would probably be a very good place to start. However, I would not recommend this product to those trying to build lean muscle.<br /><br />Overall: I would say this product would do well for those trying to put on weight quickly. It's high calorie content against a decent amount of protein makes it a pretty good weight-gainer. However, if you are either trying to lose fat or put on lean muscle, I would not recommend use of this product."

Just a pinch in the skillet with a little olive oil flavors anything I cook in it so nicely. The smell is VERY strong, but only before you cook with it. After it is in the oil or food you are cooking it mellows out to a nice onion/garlicy scent and taste.

I used it for a year then switched to a holistic, premium brand dry kibble (Wysong), and am now considering going back to Dr. Harvey's. This is why:<br /><br />1--On Dr. Harvey's, there was less poop, it was practically odorless, and healthy and firm (the higher quality food you give your dog, the less it stinks and the less comes out. I've noticed a huge difference now that we're on kibble.)<br /><br />2--It gives your dog a variety of food. Every time you make a new batch, you rotate the protein source--chicken, beef, scrambled eggs, turkey, fish, and even chickpeas and lentils (both of which our dogs LOVED!) and a different oil source (flax oil, fish oil, olive oil, sesame oil). I know people have done it for years, but it just can't be completely healthy to feed your pet the same exact thing day after day, year after year. There's just something very counter-intuitive about that...<br /><br />3--My dogs' breath was better on Dr. Harvey's--no joke! I brush my dogs' teeth every night and I can tell that it's gotten worse since we stopped feeding them Dr. Harvey's (and nothing's changed in the brushing).<br /><br />Now, I should let you know why we switched from Dr. Harvey's in the first place:<br /><br />1--It is a little on the expensive side. You can rotate with cheaper protein sources (lentils or chickpeas for $1/lb or eggs) to make it more affordable some weeks, but dogs need MEAT, and the only kind worth buying--that doesn't come from horrific living conditions and is not pumped with hormones--is expensive (though for good reason--watch ""Food, Inc.""). I found boiling whole chickens made it more affordable ($4/lb) than deboned chicken breasts ($8/lb), but they still need that beef, and that we couldn't get that too often for them. (Ethical turkey is expensive, too.)<br /><br />2--It's a bit high maintenance (my husband would say 'very'). There were several times we ran out and I had to go to the store, come back and cook up a batch for my hungry dogs (1 hour after 'asking' for it...). Now that we're on kibble it's so simple and convenient, and our dogs go hungry less often.  (Note: if you are more organized than me--which is likely--you probably wont run into this problem :) Also--you could also do this differently--we weighed out each and every portion we gave our dogs (one got 7.5oz, one got 4.5oz per meal), and that also added some time. Also, it takes 10 minutes to defrost it if it's frozen and you didn't defrost ahead of time. Dr. Harvey's also added more dishes (for the cooking, the measuring), which is tough living in a small, NYC dishwasher-less apartment.<br /><br />Those two last points aside, I kind of miss our Dr. Harvey's days. It always deeply warmed my heart to feed my dogs 'real' food that was so colorful (peas, carrots, spinach, beets!) and that smelled sooo good! We'll see--if their 'conditions' don't improve (bad breath, softish stool, itchiness), we might go back to Dr. Harvey's (and if we can find a place to get affordable, ethical meats.)<br /><br />And just because this Amazon ad does a horrible job of telling you about the product, here are some important details:<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Brown Rice, Organic Kamut, Organic Oats, Organic Spelt, Organic Barley, Organic Triticale, Potatoes*, Carrots*, Zucchini*, Sweet Potatoes**, Peas**, Broccoli, Green Beans, Beets, Calcium Citrate, Parsley, Lecithin, Garlic, Bee Pollen, Nutritional Yeast, Alfalfa, Rose Hips, Red Clover, Oat Straw, Flax Seed Meal*, Papaya, Rosemary, Dandelion, Peppermint, Ginger, Spirulina*, Fenugreek*, Basil Leaf, Fennel Seed. (*Dehydrated; **Freeze-Dried) (incredible, right?!?!)<br /><br />And how we made it:<br />1--Pick a protein and cook it up (our dogs didn't take to raw beef or chicken very well, but you can also do raw). Weigh the cooked protein--this determines the proportions of everything else you add (water, Dr. Harvey's Mix, and oil). Process protein if need be (boiled chicken or turkey breasts, hard-boiled eggs.)<br />2--Boil up needed amount of water in a big pot. When boiled, add needed amount of Dr. Harvey's dehydrated mix to the boiled water. Cover and let it sit and rehydrate for 8 minutes.<br />3--After 8 minutes, add the cooked protein to the big pot of rehydrated Dr. Harvey's mix. Add needed amount of oil. Mix it all up, and it's done! (The dogs go NUTS over the first, warm batch of Dr. Harvey's! I don't blame them--it smells sooo good!)<br /><br />We would make big batches and put 3-days' worth in the fridge (maximum amount of time) and freeze the rest.<br /><br />Note: it took us a while to figure out what proportions we needed for what. The instructions on the sheet inside give you guidance, but I ended up making my own chart because their's wasn't very helpful.  Also--we needed a scale (you might, too) to measure out how much protein you have--which will determine how much Mix, water and oil to use. It's a little tricky, but definitely manageable.<br /><br />Dr. Harvey's is fantastic, and he has a grain-free version, too (Veg-to-Bowl), which I have yet to try. I forgot to mention--I even spoke to Dr. Harvey myself when I had questions! How's that for customer service?!<br /><br />In sum, Dr. Harvey's is great if you're a very conscientious pet parent and know what's good for your pets (like me) but not so great if you're a struggling grad student short of time and cash (like me). Good luck!"

It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!"

I found this product through a friend who has dogs with similar finicky eating habits. My two dogs would pick at or just turn their noses up to any of the generally available brands in the supermarket as well as food I got at my vet. They had also been having skin irritation problems. As soon as we changed to Dr Harvey's they wolfed down the food and after a couple months the skin irritation problems disappeared. Both dogs (1 Border Collie 13yrs and 1 BC/Australian Sheppard mix 16 yrs) had developed arthritis in hip and shoulder joints prior to starting the new food and again after a few months of the new food their pain level seemed to decrease. When the BC was 15 we had blood work done and the Vet said she had never seen blood so clean for a dog this old. We are sold on the properties of this food, and have started using it on our latest rescue dog a 1 year old Australian Cattle dog, and she loves it. The con to this food is the prep time, but we make a batch and freeze half so we are not making it every night.

27572,B000FK52B2,A94EJ4NMTPHT0,F. Webb,71,71,5,1165449600,A great option for vertical sprouting,"These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time. The larger tray would be better for big batches, but using these trays in concert can achieve the same effect. For most people (not feeding too large a family), I would suggest starting out with these and evaluating whether you often want to make larger batches than you can manage in a single smaller tray.<br /><br />There are four ""lids"" that come with this set and are all exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown).  With four lids and three trays you'll find it necessary to stack the trays if you want to cover more than one at a time. The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The ""Easy Sprouter"" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes."

They I can also drain quickly by tipping on side and holding the sprouts in. I also keep the trays in the fridge after they mature. They stack and breathe so they are very effective. I plan on buying the larger trays as well for greater farming capacity. Also more hemp bags. I also plan on trying the nut milk bags for sprouting. My only complaint on the hemp ones is they smell a little musty, like wet rope. I am going to try a little H2O2 on them to see if that lowers the smell.

Since my wife died I more or less quit growing sprouts because of this issue, so when I saw the smaller set up I thought I would give it a try.  Works great!  And the tray divider makes it even better since different sprouts can be grown at the same time, but still in small enough batches that they are eaten instead of thrown out.  But, since there are three trays there is enough capacity to grow larger batches if the need should arise.  If you like sprouts, and are at all interested in fresh ones, this set up is perfect."

27584,B000FK52B2,A2ILQMYFPP7918,G3 fan,3,3,5,1286496000,The best sprouter for leafy sprouts,"I have used this sprouter for going on ten years.  It makes great sprouts always, and you can store the sprouts right in the sprouter.  Be sure to clean it periodically, otherwise sprout quality will suffer.  It probably works well for bigger seeds to sprout as well, but I uses it exclusively for leafy/small seed types, like alfalfa, clover, radish, and other similar blends."
27585,B000FK52B2,A2UL567RGQCF38,Sage Hill Roses,5,6,2,1342483200,"Not what it was cracked up to be, for me","I've used the European style drip sprouters by Bioset, now called the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N03EK0"">Victorio VKP1013 Round Three-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, for over ten years, with good results. There was room for improvement, but overall I was content enough with the experience to lead me to expand my sprouting adventure, and now I also grow micro-greens and baby greens in trays. When I decided to take the Bioset on an extended trip and it cracked (silly me), I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to this one, on the advice of one of the various sprouting websites out there, which maligned the Bioset-style sprouters and anyone benighted enough to rely on them. The Sprout Master was billed as the best sprouter in the world, a breeze to use, handy, yadda yadda yadda. The best thing since sliced (sprouted-grain) bread.<br /><br />This was not my experience. I guess it boils down to the fact that the set up is not much different than the drip style, with the exception of increased inconvenience. The Sprout Master requires hand rinsing the seeds and sprouts rather than the pour-and-drip system. This did not bother me in and of itself, however, as I enjoy the process of working with the seeds and sprouts as much as eating them. I was happy to put in more work for better results. Also, with this sprouter, you have to soak your seeds first, which the European style ones get around by taking advantage of the varying surface tension of the water of unsprouted and sprouted seeds. When they are unsprouted, a bit of the water sits in the trays, allowing a mini-soak. Once they sprout, more of the water continues its process from tray to tray to the receptacle. If you are really concerned about too much water sitting there (one of the complaints from the sprouting site), you just give it a few quick shakes, and off goes the water. Here, again, I was unperturbed: I like the process of nurturing my sprouts. Nevertheless, I began to wonder whether the results would be much improved.<br /><br />They weren't. It seems there are operational differences as well as the design distinctions. First, the holes for dripping, which I really did like at first to allow for good clean rinsing, are too large to hold alfalfa, mustard, and similar small seeds, even after soaking overnight. You lose even more as you rinse them for the first day or two. Then, unless you mist the seeds, rinsing tumbles them all around, in addition to pushing some through the holes in the early phase. This means that you don't get nice vertical sprouts unless you are uber-careful. Were that not enough, my first batch just got rotten, moldy, and nasty--something that has never happened to me in over a decade of using the drip sprouters. So I resolved to try again, thinking that maybe I didn't pay attention to placing the lids on properly (necessary in order to allow for air circulation). But first I had to pry sprout roots out of the holes without breaking the the sprouter (the build quality is not encouraging), and to poke out the seeds that had wedged into the holes when small and begun to grow, which I'd also never had to do with the drip sprouters. The second time around I got somewhat better results, but they still did not begin to compare to my standard Bioset crop, even ignoring the extra effort and loss of seeds. Far fewer seeds sprouted (and I'm using the same mix as ever), and they were a knotted mess. I could get equally uninspiring results from a mason jar and cheesecloth.<br /><br />Perhaps this sprouter does well with larger seeds or sprouts that you do not intend to grow vertically. It may be, too, that a little perseverance and a few good new tricks for the smaller seed crops would have made this sprouter useful to me, but I did not see the point. I knew I could do better, and the 30-day deadline for returns was glowering. So I sent it back, and am now trying Victorio's updated drip sprouter, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FVPP04"">Victorio VKP1014 4-Tray Kitchen Seed Sprouter</a>, which, though still not ideal, I much prefer to the Sprout Master. The new model is BPA free, made of crack-resistant plastic, does away with the little drain spigots of the previous version (an admitted nuisance), and comes with a lid you can use to store the sprouts in a tray in the fridge. At half the price of the Sprout Master. So far, my first set of sprouts (again, using the same mix) did just dandy, without loss of seeds, mold, rot, tumbled sprouts, marauding roots or seed-clogged holes. Plus it looks oh so pretty with the sprouts all green and alive and vertical in there. (The Sprout Master is opaque, so you can't see the sprouts once they've grown--nor would you necessarily want to, unless you have the patience to pamper your seeds so they grow vertically.)<br /><br />In sum, I really wanted to like this sprouter, and feel like a ""real"" kitchen gardener. But I just didn't. In the end, what sets a real gardener apart is a harvest, not a name brand."

I purchased it when I first got interested in sprouting based on great feedback. But sometimes it seemed like too much. Since there are only two of us, I used the divider and sprouted two different kinds of seeds at once. Yet, it still was more than I could use in a week. Then I came across the mini sprouter! How cool is this? Each tray has a divider so if I want, I can actually sprout 6 different types of seeds at once. They stack on top of each other and take up such a small footprint on my counter. Even better, is that someone asked me to sprout some seeds for them and I was able to give them the ""layer"" with their seeds already sprouted and ready to finish crisping in the fridge. When they are done eating them, I will take the layer back and begin another sort of seed. The mini is the perfect size for one or two people. The larger is great for families or sharing. Quality construction, easy to clean and again, each has a divider you can use or take out when not needed. This would be a great gift with organic seeds for a newlywed couple or someone wanting to bypass the store purchased sprouts that are causing many health problems. I heard Kroger is no longer selling sprouts at all. Eat healthy and use a no fail product to sprout. This fits the ticket."

I've tried a handful of major-brand canned chili, you know the ones I mean, and always walked away disappointed. Needing something meaty that could be eaten as a meal, I was determined to find a decent canned chili. Normally I would have passed over this brand because it contains no meat, but I made a mistake and ordered it without realizing this. I'm not a vegetarian and have only found out since ordering it that Worthington is a vegetarian-only brand name. Well, it's a mistake I don't regret, because the absence of meat in this chili is not a problem at all. The company replaced the meat in an otherwise-excellent chili recipe with what I believe is mashed tofu along with some other natural stuff that congeals and even looks convincingly like meat. Thanks to the natural heavy spicing of chili, the taste of tofu is camouflaged, and only the taste of the delicious beans and spices comes through. The consistency is perfect, being just watery enough to not require added water, but still being solid enough to not be a tasteless soup. Bottom line: I find myself, a perfectly contented meat-eater, to be craving this chili at least once a week."

It does not have the thin, sour taste that most of the single-culture starters produce. The taste is instead smooth and full-bodied. It is also thicker than most when a little dry milk is added. The process takes a bit longer, since the milk must be heated to 180 degrees, then cooled to 75. The cooling requires an ice-water bath, or the temperature would never get that low in our kitchen. After 12 hours in the Yogourmet Multi, which starts at room temperature and very gradually increases to 112 degrees, the yogurt is perfect every time.

So, I'd recommend using this to start the culture, but then using yogurt from then on.

Cooking at this temperature kills any harmful bacteria in the milk that remains even after pasteurization. It also breaks down the proteins in the milk insuring a great yogurt SET. Apparently, the proteins are easier for your body to digest in this broken down state as well. Cool the 2 quarts of milk to 112 degrees, add starter, (10 grams freeze dried starter or 1/2 cup leftover yogurt from original batch) 1 1/2 cups optional powdered milk, up to 1 cup optional sugar and up to 1 tablespoon optional flavoring extracts. Incubate until desired tartness is reached. My kids prefer the maximum sugar so the yogurt tastes more like store bought. Although with this much sugar, the milk takes longer to turn into yogurt - up to 24 hours. Try using honey extract, vanilla extract, raspberry extract, etc."
27678,B001EO69NS,A1SHHQSPOWR00F,just another customer,9,9,5,1282003200,Infallable,"I used two of the 5 gram pouches for a gallon of milk (one sleeve for a total of 10 grams).  I do not have a yogurt maker and used a stainless steel pot on the stove.  After the heating process, I put the cultured milk in my oven to incubate over about 8 hours (longer than suggested).  Periodically, I'd turn the oven on for a minute or so to get the mixture about 100 degrees F, but I bet the temperature fluxuated quite a bit.<br /><br />I then strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a few hours (while sitting at room temperature).  The yogurt is far tastier and smoother than Fage brand Greek-style yogurt.  It's about the consistency of very thick mayonaise or sour cream.  I doubt I will ever eat mayo or sour cream again.<br /><br />The starter is very forgiving.  Now that I have cultured yogurt, I'll probably use the mother instead of the starter.<br /><br />If you are interested in instructions or a recipe, although I did not follow this book exactly, it's a great reference:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931498237"">Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods</a>"
27679,B001EO69NS,A21QTX0H1OSGRN,David Kelly,5,5,5,1270857600,The easy way,"In one of the reviews of the Yogourmet incubator someone wished for a yogurt maker that was more like a toaster.  They wanted to put the milk in and take yogurt out.  This can almost be done with the Yogourmet Machine and the CBA culture.  Here's how.  Purchase two quart boxes of Organic Valley Whole shelf stable milk.  You find these not in the Dairy case but out on store shelves.  Then purchase a package of Organic Valley Non-Fat dry milk.  Are you good with this so far?  The only tricky part is warming the shelf stable boxed milk up to 77°.  I took a big cooking pot and put it in the sink and set the two closed boxes of milk in the pan and filled it with 80° tap water.  Around a half hour later the milk was the right temperature.  I ran some scalding water into my Yogourmet batch container for a mini-sanitize and to warm it slightly.  Then I added the two boxes of shelf stable milk.  Into this I mixed around 3 ounces of powdered milk using a hand mixer.  Verify that your milk is the correct temperature and put 4 ounces of the milk into a cup and mix in the two packages of the CBA starter.  Now pour and stir this back into the batch container and put the container in the Yogourmet incubator and add sufficient 77° water around the batch container and plug in the unit.  In 12 hours you will have your yogurt the easy way.  No heating, no cooling just making Yogurt the easy ""like toast"" way."

The high temperature changes the protein in the milk so the yogurt<br />sets better, just like when making custard from scratch.<br /><br />I use a yogoutmet model T yogurt maker, which is cool. and run it for 10 hours. This<br />converts most of the sugar, making the resulting yogurt nice and sour, the way I like it.<br />At this point you can use it in place of sour cream, and it will also stay intact better at<br />higher temperatures. If you thicken it bit more, by removing some of the whey, you<br />will have the thickness of Greek-style yogurt. You can also thicken it more to use in<br />place of cream cheese."

Otherwise just use a dollop of an otherwise edible yogurt as a starter and chance the result.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose so if you're attempting to be paleo/primal you will need to weigh up whether that's acceptable or not.<br /><br />Bland and firm vs runny and tangy.

I have not strayed from the Davidson's loose bulk here on Amazon at such a great price but thought I would give this one a try.  The tea itself looks nice - partial leaves, better quality leaves than what I had seen so far out of other cheaper teas.  The taste is decent as well.  I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought ""Hey it happens"".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.<br /><br />This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.

Even then there is some quirky chocolaty flavor.<br /><br />Finish your newly purchased tea quickly or, better, put it into your own spare tin boxes because this type of packaging will not keep it fresh for long.<br /><br />Next time I will probably pay more and buy some silver needle white tea (higher quality than white peony).

Well Lindt has this chocolate which tastes absolutely awesome and goes with any occassion. You can either get the milk chocolate or go for the assorted one which has dark and other cocoa variations of chocolates. There is a myth that Lindt has liquor in all of its chocolates which is not so - Most Lindt in USA will only have cocoa liquor. Dark chocolates with whisky and other liquor variants are normally available from European markets - I got it few days back - available in Amazon. An amazing chocolate that melts so much in your much and makes you go crazy over its taste. In my opinion, truffles are the best chocolates Lindt has ever made over these years. Affordable price has mentioned at Amazon - you don't get that many deals for these stufss as these are preferred round the year.

So when Amazon offered them at a special price and sent directly from Amazon with free shipping, even better, right?<br /><br />Wrong. I don't know how these were stored but they arrived in mid-April when temps in Chicago the entire week before had ranged from the low 30s to the mid 50s, but they'd obviously been subjected to much warmer conditions. The shells were soft and kind of sticky and with none of the usual Lindt gloss, and the fillings were almost the same texture. The taste was barely adequate but the texture was not even close to what it should be even if you'd bought them off a grocer's shelf and a number of them even had dents in the shells although so far none seem to have been completely melted.<br /><br />If you can buy them directly from Lindt in the middle of December, you'll probably be ok.

Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue. The rest were still puckered with indentations on them. But I tried to pick the least worst ones. I opened some up to see how they taste because of the bad quality of them, in wrapped form. They did taste amazing as usual. What an embarrassment at a $30,000 plus venue. I sent an email to Sue""s Shirt Shop and More (seller through Amazon). They informed me that they were perfect at time of shipment, but wanted the order number. On October 3, I provided them the info and told them they were by far not perfect when received, that I did not have them in any heat (that I was home at time of delivery) and wondered how could they tell me they were in perfect condition at time of shipment unless they themselves physically inspected each one. As of this date, I have not heard back. I do know that we paid $10.98 for shipping and handling and would think that USPS was not responsible for their condition; however, only Amazon.com would know that. The issue of shipping never came up. But in the end, the customer (us) got the shaft. For the price we paid, we could have bought each piece individually in a local shop. Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn't leave a bad impression on the candy table at our daughter's wedding, which was otherwise elegant.

First off the color of the one we received is way lighter than the one illustrated. I specifically want a color close to that shown to match our new kitchen cabinets. Right away upon using it AS a cutting board, small chips started coming off of the cutting surface and with just over a month of use, the board is now warped from being rinsed off under warm tap water so that it wobbles from side to side, definitely not what you want to happen when you are trying to cut something. Lastly, be aware that these boards are made of multiple pieces of wood glued together, ours is 4 pieces. I doubt this board will last half as long as the bamboo board it replaced."

This year, I was determined to paint the town -- and myself, if need be, inside and out -- GREEN.<br /><br />St. Paddy's Day just isn't the same without a wee tipple or three of the old witches' brew. Sadly, I couldn't find real Irish whiskey available for sale on Amazon. So I did the next best thing and bought these fine Irish mustards, made with the very hair of the dog I was looking for.<br /><br />I'm Irish enough to know that fine whiskey from the old country should be messed with as little as possible. So when the condiments arrived, I filled a nice fresh highball glass with a few ice cubes, scooped in three fingers of wholegrain Irish whiskey mustard, and sipped it by a roaring fire.<br /><br />I can't say this product was quite as 'smooth' as the other Irish whiskeys I've had. The color was rich and dark, and I definitely detected a hint of the familiar smoky peat. But most of the other characteristics I was looking for seemed masked -- muted somehow by a very front-forward... how should I say it? ""Mustardiness,"" I think would be the technical term.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't recommend sipping this neat.

The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it.

It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this ""puppy goo"".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.

""Celebrate with a Friends"" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.<br /><br />The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation/organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich brown ribbon with a card -- all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.<br /><br />I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience -- indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1-star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov/early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of browsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective."

To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting ."

Where I might use five with larger quantities like a jamabalya. There is is pleanty of room to adjust as your heat tolerance grows. At this rate the bottle should last a year or so. By the time I am done maybee I will be ready for the 357."

He used to grab the bag out of the pantry to ask for it.  Now I have added it to his picture cards so he can flip through the cards and ask for it.  He loves the texture and the shapes and colors are fun.  The rest of the family will eat it as well.

We love them and they work great for our GFCF diet, however, they do fall apart quite easily - and that's with cooking them just until done.  Unlike traditional pasta, they are not the greatest when they are ""leftovers"" because they lose a lot of moisture and harden.  Overall, a pretty good product and we are happy to have them so that we don't miss out on pasta simply because we do not eat gluten."

I loved the consistency actually; it was like a light cream rather than a starchy thick soup. But, I can never leave well enough alone. I saut&eacute;ed three sweet carrots in 1 teaspoon of oil, then added the soup to heat, and served it up with some chopped avocado. The combination was delightful.<br /><br />The soup on its own had a wonderful taste and just the right amount of flavor in terms of heat (not too much!), spices, and salt. Nothing was over the top, and it all melded rather nicely. There was just one note that kept tasting ""off"" to me. It was mostly in the aftertaste, so it didn't deter me from devouring the bowl. Nonetheless, it left me curious, so I checked the ingredients and finally spotted the culprit ... cilantro paste. Yes, I am one of those cilantro supertasters who generally dislike it. Cilantro fans will find this soup spot on, but luckily, the cilantro is far enough down the ingredient list that even most ""cilantro tastes like soap"" people (such as me) will enjoy it.<br /><br />I will purchase this soup again either for a quick lunch, or as a recipe starter ... it has great potential!

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"

Now that I know they have new products, may try those. (Yes they have a new brisket sauce. I'll still use this on my brisket. Can't go wrong with perfection. Brisket recipe: Take a brisket with a nice slab of fat over it (you can take it off later) not too thick not too thin (you need this for keeping the meat moist and tender). Pour 1-2 bottles over the brisket (depends on the size) in a deep roasting pan (I use an enamel pan)deep enough to be able to put a piece of foil over the top without touching the brisket. Seal the edges of the foil around the pan to make a tent. Put in the oven at 250-275 degrees for a few hours. ( Frozen brisket is even better) if frozen, then cook longer (at least double time) You can check it from time to time. Watch out for the steam when you roll back a corner/side. Check with a fork to see if it starts to flake, taste it, you'll know if it's done. This will be the flaky, moistest brisket you ever ate. (skim off the fat and throw away). S-l-o-w cooking is the way to go with brisket. This marinade is what makes it sooooo good."

It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two.

Now, I make my own using Quaker's ""Old Fashioned Oats,"" (or Target's cheaper equivalent), which takes only 10 minutes or so, allows me to control the sweetness to my liking by adding the maple syrup and brown sugar myself, and doesn't give me any ""artificial flavors"" or ""guar gum,"" or ""caramel color.""<br /><br />Given that, I will say that, for an instant product, this is pretty good, though just a bit too sweet for me. Its first ingredient is Whole Grain Rolled Oats (although the second is sugar) and it does have a reasonably creamy consistency which you would expect from oatmeal. I actually preferred Quaker's high fiber variation of this product, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MWASW6"">Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple Brown Sugar, 12.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. I think that one is a little less sweet than this one and the 10 grams of fiber is an attraction if you're trying (like I am) to get more fiber into your diet.<br /><br />It's absurd to compare this to ""old fashioned"" or ""steel cut"" oatmeal. This is a convenience product that requires no preparation and which you would use when you don't have the time or inclination to fuss with the others.

It's also pretty instant and fills you up, even if you need to eat two packets at a time to actually feel full.

Unlike all the complainers, I'm not addicted to the ""original"" flavor and honestly couldn't tell you there was a difference between this and the ""old"" version.  Basically, if you don't eat it five days a week, you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />Overall I like the texture of this as well.  I tend to make mine straight from the packet and with boiling water from an electric kettle and sometimes I've had products that don't mix well that way and I'm stuck eating crunchy oats instead of, well, the proper gooey kind.

Though sugar is the second ingredient, whole grain rolled oats is the first ingredient in every flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, including this Maple Brown Sugar, which is a favorite of mine. Further, each serving (one packet) contains only four grams of sugar in the low sugar form and nine grams in the regular form, which is one to two teaspoons.<br /><br />Yeah, one or two teaspoons.<br /><br />I went through the rest of the ingredients on the Maple Brown Sugar flavor and on several others, and almost every other ingredient is an ingredient you'd find in a vitamin pill. The Apples & Cinnamon even has dehydrated apples (ahead of sugar, which is the third ingredient in that flavor).<br /><br />I'm recovering from chemotherapy and radiation. I had a bone marrow transplant in January (2012), and my new immune system sometimes goes after my gut when we lower my immunosuppressives. Thus, eating food that is high in fiber and gentle on the stomach and intestines is important for me. It's important for you, too, because the fiber in oats is excellent for your heart.<br /><br />The problem is, it's hard for me to find oatmeal edible without adding a lot more brown sugar than Quaker does! That's always been true, but it's especially true when I'm recovering from leukemia treatments. At first, there was a VERY limited set of food items I could eat without throwing up. (Sorry for being so graphic.) These flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals let me eat gentle, heart-healthy oatmeal without hating the flavor. I love almost every one. They're a go-to food for me when I'm nauseous.<br /><br />I know you probably aren't recovering from a blood cancer, but if you're wanting to eat oatmeal because it's healthy, this is a great way to eat it.<br /><br />And for lazy people, it's a one-bowl cleanup. Pour the packet in the bowl, pour boiling water over it, and wait a minute (or less if you're impatient like me). Eat it, and you have one bowl and no pots to wash (or throw in the dishwasher)."

I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it.

I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy.

It does not taste as sweet as it sounds, and by adding a few fresh fruits to the mix, sliced bananas, apples, or strawberries or any other variety, one has a meal during the morning hours.  After consuming all 10-packets, most likely, one may want to try other flavors."

I like that these instant oatmeals are great for on the go and are a better fast breakfast option than most cold, sugary cereals.  My biggest problem with this oatmeal is the sugar content.  Although one packet might be fine for a toddler, anyone over 8 years old would probably need two packets for breakfast; however, with 12 grams of sugar in one packet, that means a two-packet breakfast gives you a whopping 24 grams of sugar!  A better option is to make a bowl of oatmeal, not instant, add less sugar or a sugar substitute, then add spices or other ingredients of your choice. It takes a little more time and effort, but the result is a better tasting, healthier oatmeal."

Maple Brown Sugar is one of my ""go to"" flavors - it disappears from the variety pack first and it's the one I seek out at the store (along with apple).  I'm also big on cutting costs at the grocery store, so I avoid name brands that aren't truly worth the extra money.  So, the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff.<br /><br />There really is no comparison.  The store brands are a real disappointment.  The oats don't absorb the water properly.  The flavoring doesn't dissolve.  The texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra.  The taste is the cloying side.  On the other hand, Quaker absorbs the water, the flavoring dissolves, the texture is nicely bumpy and three-dimensional, and the brown sugar is just enough.<br /><br />Don't go cheap on oatmeal or you'll be sorry.  If you want to save a buck on your oatmeal, buy the real stuff in bulk on Amazon."

It isn't the heartiest oatmeal, but the addition of a banana and or raisins bulks it up considerably, and makes it a more complete balanced meal or snack.

The new version's hearty oats and natural flavor wasn't a hit with me.  I emailed Quaker with my complaint and they nicely sent me a $5 coupon to use on any Quaker product which I used for Life cereal.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I wasn't the only one complaining about the New & Improved recipe because now Quaker has returned to their tried 'n' true Classic Recipe.

There was plenty of maple flavor.<br /><br />There are two options for preparing the instant oatmeal, one involving boiling water, the other tap water and the microwave.  I combined the two, because I like really hot oatmeal.  First I added boiling water, as directed, and let the oatmeal stand for a minute or so.  Then I gave it a 15-second nuke in the microwave.

It's had a chemical-like smell and was EXTREMELY salty -- and I am a person that salts everything and it was way too salty for me to even eat. It was just all around nasty popcorn.<br /><br />This year I decided I'm going to break out the popcorn machine and use it again, but I needed to get different popcorn.  I wanted to allow myself enough time this year that if I didn't like the popcorn I ordered, I would have time to order replacements before the party.  Last week I ordered the Real Theater popcorn kits and OMG! I LOVE it!  It tastes really good like movie theater popcorn or the popcorn you get at the popcorn carts at the zoo or amusement parks.  My house smelled really good like popcorn you just had to have.  I even stepped outside for a little bit and walked back in to see how the smell would hit you if you were just walking in the house.  It was fabulous!"

Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy. Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet. Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too). You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping. While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl. Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is about $2.40 per pack (or $1.66 per pouch in the 15 pack), which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost).

Henry,0,0,2,1324944000,Not so good,"I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this ""Real Theater"" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is ""bad"" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of ""real"" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be ""artificial"" and ""thick"".  ""Thick"", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent ""real theaters"" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste."

Peregrine Cavendish named after the 12th Duke of Devonshire), were traveling the Bay of Bengal in the summer of 1938.  King George IV, had taken reign the winter prior.  His royal majesty from the House of Windsor still had a tentative grip on the British colony of India.  Hearken back to olden days of yore when imperialism was a goal, and not a mangy politicians word.<br /><br />We were making headway up the Hooglhy River into Calcutta under the guise of His Majesty's Royal Trade Mission with peace offerings to the Maharaja of Bengal.  Calcutta was a dicey place round about that time, being our capital in colonized India you know.  The locals had grown weary of the legendary British hospitality.  A fortnight later, it was near the mouth of the Hooglhy River that we met a blind street beggar who promised us visions of prosperity.  At first we questioned this diminutive cheeky fellow, but alas, we listened to his tale.  We offered the blind beggar six British royal pounds in exchange for his gift of visions of prosperity.  And that is when it happened.  The blind beggar offered us this strange, yet edible fruit.  ""Eat the fruit of this Pomegranate"", the blind beggar said, ""and the visions of your prosperity will come to light"".<br /><br />For good penance, the blind beggar gave us seven pomegranates for our continued journey.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, a fine purveyor of English tea's, and the second most knowledgeable of my sailor's had a unique idea.  Boson's Mate Micklegal decided to steep some loose black tea leaves with blueberries we picked up from our travels along the coast of Palestine along with the strange edible portions of the blind beggar's pomegranate.  Much to our extreme delight, what an explosion of flavor!  I informed Boson's Mate Micklegal that he was definitely on to something.  While this delicious concoction was certainly no Earl Grey (as any honorable Britain would tell you, there's no comparison to ""The Earl""), it was certainly divine, chamomile be damned!  Though summer's on the Bay of Bengal were most treacherous, with a cup of Blueberry and Pomegranate Tea by your side while fixing the braggywinkle's on the bowline, the fresh smell of the salty air on your lips, a better day one cannot achieve.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Boson's Mate Micklegal found a bottle of Glen Fiddyich stowed away in one of the hold's.  Boson's Mate Micklegal ended up getting pissed off the fine scotch and forgot his wonderful concoction.  In his plastered stupor, Boson's Mate Micklegal heaved the six remaining Pomegranate's off the aft deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, losing the wonderful recipe forever.  What Rubbish.<br /><br />Until the hack tea makers at the Lipton company devised their own version of Blueberry Pomegranate Tea.  While not as divine as the tea Boson's Mate Micklegal concocted in that summer of 1938, they came darn bloody close.  Cheers Lipton!  Thanks for the memories."

That's the first problem.  The name of each of these pyramid teas says you're getting 1 tea, when in fact you are getting at least 2, and then a mountain of other ingredients -- most of which are not even hinted at by the name.<br /><br />It's true, white tea is the first ingredient listed.  Then green tea.  Then apple pieces.  Then a litany of all the cheap add-ins available to fill a tea bag.  The pom -- is barely there at all, in the form of juice concentrated and then powdered into bits.  And blueberry is so far down the list that it's barely there at all.<br /><br />Of 15 listed ingredients, all the fruit (except the apple) are listed AFTER cornstarch and ""natural flavor"".<br /><br />What kind of tea is this that has blueberry and pom in the name -- yet has more cornstarch and the mysterious ""natural flavor"" than the microscopic bits of fruit and juice?<br /><br />CORNSTARCH?  In tea?  forget this stuff and find some Numi, or Republic of Tea, or Stash, or Celestial Seasonings tea that has the actual tea (white? green? black? rooibos? mint? chamomile?) in the name -- and then only minimal anything-else.  No fillers.  No thickeners.  No crap.  Almost any of the name companies in this price range give you more actual tea (and identifiable other ingredients) than this.<br /><br />And it tastes bad.

Maybe I didn't make it right, but I've made other teas that came out just fine.<br />I've bought a bottled version of it from another brand and expected a similar taste out of this tea I bought today. I tasted nothing. I let it steep and steep and steep, taking sips ever so often to see if the flavor ever came out.<br /><br />I think the most disappointing thing about it is its box and smell. It's box describes it as ""pomegranate blueberry"" flavor. I tasted neither. It had such a seductive aroma, so much so, I could smell it while it was still packaged and I admit it was what persuaded me to buy it.<br /><br />I let my mother try it, and she described it perfectly:  even though it had a lovely aroma, it wasn't flavoring the water.<br />I noticed that there was an ""apple-y"" after taste at least. Lipton's just needs to step it up and make it a bit stronger so you can actually taste it. I don't know if it is because I have a natural affinity for stronger tea, or what, but I cannot begin with how disappointed I was, especially for the price I paid in store. If a tea has a fruit flavor added, I want to taste the fruit. I would rather it have a robust, full-bodied flavor.

Try making one batch with the cheapest semisweet chocolate at the store (Nestle or Hershey's or whatever) and one batch with Dagoba Dark. Then serve them to your friends and see which they prefer. It makes an obvious and remarkable difference.<br /><br />And for plain old eating, it's equally tasty.

The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.  Darby is 4.6 years and Hampshire is 3.11 years."

I like saving money, but I believe that buying these over the individually wrapped Pack of 84 is a mistake.  I actually bought these and the individually wrapped variety of the same product, so I think I can be a good judge on this decision.<br /><br />One note:  Don't be confused by the picture of this product.  It is NOT individually wrapped as shown.<br /><br />Here's why I can't recommend these:<br /><br />They are dried out, especially compared to the individually wrapped ones.  When I bite into one of these its kind of chewy, not moist at all, has less taste, and is less appealing overall than the individually wrapped ones.  The individually wrapped ones has a lot more taste, moistness (making it easier to bite into), and when you bite into it, you can really taste the freshness.<br /><br />The other, more important reason is that 90% of the time these have caused me... lets just call it ""issues"" in the bathroom shortly after eating them.  I have always had an iron stomach, but I have one stick and these ""issues"" start occurring.  This has been the case since the day I bought them.  This is not AT ALL the case with the individually wrapped beef sticks.  I can have two of those and experience no ""issues.""  I double checked the date on the box (they were new) and also insured that I was properly storing these sticks (I was).  So I really can only blame the fact that they are not fresh enough because they are not individually wrapped.  Possibly there's something more to this.  Maybe Jack Links put more preservatives in the bagged sticks to keep them fresher since they aren't individually wrapped.  I don't know, but this would make some sense.<br /><br />Please, do yourself a favor and buy the individually wrapped version of these sticks.  Its worth the extra money for the freshness you get from unwrapping each stick and to not possibly experience ""issues, which will lead to buyers remorse."

Then now they have this concentrated creamer which is the best yet, we beleive it tastes better than the liquid and the powdered.  Also, it gives you more for your dollar.  The only downside is the pump.  Really cool idea if you could only remove it after putting it on.  I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.  We leave it off and just pour it into the coffee, and when there is only a little left, we pour some coffee in it and get the rest out.

It says it should be used within a month but (unless it's used by one person/one cup per day) this wont last anymore than a couple of weeks.  It is not as concentrated (I had to pump 3-4 times), and the past reviewer is right it is not as rich as the refrigerated kind.  We have three people who drink coffee here, it was gone in 2 weeks.<br /><br />I was upset about it gone so soon, but felt some liquid left behind in the bottle; unfortunately the nozzle can't be removed due to a lock system it has; once it's on, its on for good!  I took a butter knife to open the cap and to my surprise there was enough liquid there for at least 5 more cups of coffee!<br /><br />On top of that the second bottle kept clogging even with twice daily use.  And now Amazon had raised the price!  I decided to go with the plain creamer this time, much more economical.  I will test and review it as soon as I finish the first bottle I hope it works better for us.<br /><br />It very pricey, sure no mess, no hassle if you've got loads of money there's really nothing to worry about.

The flavor reminds you of sweet condensed milk.  Someone in a previous review said you cannot take the pump off once it is put on. The manufacturer must have changed this because it now just unscrews so you can clean the pump if necessary and also get the last drops that won't pump out.

At this price, it's best reserved for special recipes.  I'm sure I'll use it up making waffles or other baked treats, however I wouldn't use it for basic purposes, such was sweetening coffee.

If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is."

The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required.

I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product.

I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again."

I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.

I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water.

I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!"

I like it with just a tiny bit of sweetener and a wedge of lemon.  That being said, to get the amount and strength I like for my tea I have to use 2 k-cups for one cup of tea.  I usually do two 6 oz brews and it is just right.  I can go up to an 8 oz brew and still have good flavor but I want more than 8oz at a time.  For me it is just too expensive to use 2 k-cups at a time.  I have compromised with myself and still keep the k-cups around to use if I am in a hurry (or just extra lazy) but I mostly just use the tea bags of the same flavor.  I find it really isn't much more difficult or time consuming to use my keurig machine for hot water to steep a tea bag in.  The tea bags are just much more economical for me."

The white rice pasta I bought at the store was mushy and didn't hold its shape.  It was a pale imitation of the ""real thing"" (i.e. wheat pasta)  But Tinkyada's pasta I can enjoy eating.  As long as you cook according to the directions, you can't tell it's not ""normal"" pasta. I usually add a bit of oil to the water with the pasta to discourage sticking, because I don't do a very good job remembering to stir it!  It's also brown rice-based, so it's healthier for you.  One warning, if you put plain pasta in the fridge, it will be hardened when you pull it out.  But, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again.  If you store it with sauce, then this problem is avoided.<br /><br />I've tried four shapes of Tinkyada pasta, and this is definitely my favorite.  The fusilli is like a hollow spaghetti, with a slight twist to it.  With the interesting shape of spiral/rotini pasta, but without the bulkiness.  It seems very fancy, but doesn't really cost a whole lot more.  This is the shape we use most often.  We use it with marinara sauce, meat sauce, chicken parmesan, chicken noodle soup, etc.  Very versatile.  Highly recommended to anyone who can't eat wheat/gluten."

And getting it from Amazon make it far easier too, since we can't find most of their products in our reasonably large city - we have to drive 100 miles to the REALLY big city.

From a happy ALO Junkie!!!,"I was lucky enough to have been in Hawaii last summer- where i first discovered this amazing drink! At first- i was a little freaked out when i tasted the Aloe pulp ( as i was not expecting that); but after enjoying my very first bottle- i was automatically hooked on the taste, the benefits with the aloe; and i could not drink enough of it.<br /><br />Then- to my dismay- upon returning to Montreal, Canada where I live; I could not find it anywhere!!! The only places that I could find it online were in other provinces- and they would not ship to Montreal. (nor was it cost efficient for me)<br />Then a month ago- I was shopping in one of our largest grocery stores (IGA Select) and found it in their health section....but at over $3.50 for a small bottle- as much as I liked it- it was a little steep.<br /><br />Then I found it on Amazon- probably at the best price you can find anywhere; and even with free shipping. (They dont ship to Canada either- but I have it shipped to a USA address and a friend brings it home for me. This friendly service costs me a few bottles for sure- but well worth it!!!)<br /><br />My fridge is happily stocked with an assortment of ALO flavors; and needless to say-I have been, and will continue to; order a case or more per month!<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to trying their new flavors!!!"

Could be a little cheaper, but I only say that because I want to drink it by the truckload, and can't afford that kind of a habit.

Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.

It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)<br /><br />But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi brand but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi brand, and most other Japanese brands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!<br /><br />To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi brand just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag. I had no idea how large a bag 5 lbs of peas would be, but it turns out it's about 3 macbook pros stacked on top of each other. That bag is HUGE!<br /><br />Anyway, this..mundane tasting wasabi pea may be healthier and more organic, I don't know. But it most certainly won't turn any nonbeliever into fans.

They are crunchy and flavorful, and with a good dose of protein and fiber, these make a great healthy snack that is satisfying too. Also good if you have a cold or allergies. These wasabi peas are really good, but they aren't the best I have ever had. I really like the ones that have a lot of wasabi coating on them, even so the whole pea is covered, and I find that with this brand, there tend to be many peas with minimal coating on them. I like to feel a split second of intense regret after putting a wasabi pea in my mouth and feeling my sinuses about to implode before the spice dissipates, and these will do that if you put a solid handful in your mouth all at the same time. Maybe I have been eating too many wasabi peas and have built up some tolerance. Nonetheless, they still pack a good spicy kick overall, and are really crunchy without being too hard. The price of these is fantastic and as far as I know, you can't find a better deal out there for this level of quality, which is good because once you start they are hard to put down. I get the big bag and store them in empty pasta sauce jars or plastic food storage containers, and I like to split some up into single serving bags to take on the go. Maybe I am a little spoiled by Amazon, but shipping on these was slower than what I was expecting, as it has taken over a week both times I have ordered - but that certainly doesn't mean I won't order again!

I couldn't really taste the nuts or the fruit because of all the glucose syrup (the second ingredient on the list - honey would have been a much tastier sweetening option, but they only used a tiny bit of honey) and all of the bits of puffed white rice (again just another form of sugar) overpowers any other tastes. All I tasted was sugar and bland white rice. I did give it two stars because the bar did have a lot of nuts. Too bad I couldn't taste them. A much tastier option is the Kind brand fruit and nut bars. Theirs are also gluten-free, and they use honey as the primary sweetener and use the sweetener more sparingly, so that you can really taste the nuts and fruit. Amazon sells that brand too, and I'll be going back to that brand. These two are my faves from them:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYF0"">KIND Bar Nut Delight, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYEQ"">KIND Bar Almond & Apricot, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />Thought I'd give the Eat Natural brand a try just for variety, but it reminded me that just because something is natural, doesn't mean it's good for you. Too much glucose is not good for anyone. And remember, hemlock is natural too. That's certainly not good for you either... :)"

The reviews convinced me that this was the best on the market. As it is the ingredients and nutritional value are EXACTLY the same, number for number, word for word.. They must be made by the same manufacturer and packaged differently. So to sum it up --I paid $10.81 for 6.14 ounces as compared to buying 6 of the Kernel Seasons which would have come to $13.57 for 17.10 ounces. Big difference, I paid almost 100% more for this product which of course isn't so great either. I feel ripped off but what can I do, you can't win em all. How would I have known if I didn't order the Paragon brand and compare.. This is just my consumer alert to others.<br /><br />This is Aug 20 2012 and I just corrected my previous review.

This was not bad and much better than the stuff I'd purchased in my local grocery store, but not quite as good as the Archer Farms.  The only thing that was a bit of an annoyance was that it is very fine powder so it makes a mess when shaking onto your popcorn. Also the sodium is a little bit high per serving (75 milligrams per 1/4 tsp).  I wish that information had been in the description before I ordered it.  If you can tolerate the sodium this a great find and I would rate this 4 stars.  If you are watching your sodium then this may not be the product for you.  The 1/4 tsp serving size is not enough for 3 cups of popcorn.  For the sodium content & annoying messiness, I rate this 3 stars."

That was quite a while ago, and for some reason I'd gotten away from using it until recently. Chebe bread has come a long way! I ordered a case of the All-purpose and used it to make a nice gluten free pie crust for my Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie, and also then used it to make stuffing. And then MORE to make dinner rolls...all came out very well. I am very pleased. If you go to the Chebe website you can find many more recipes which is nice because for each recipe it tells you which versions of Chebe Bread Mix can be used for which recipes (and now there are 5 or more varieties of this Mix). I am planning on trying out the Sticky rolls and a pizza crust with this Mix so I will see how that goes. The mix, is very fine and fly away....so you want to take it easy when opening it and pouring into the bowl or you will have a fine dusting of powder around the area you are mixing it in. I have really been pretty pleased with the items I have made from the Chebe All-Purpose Mix."

Not so!  You can make all kinds of goodies with this mix, and we keep it as a pantry staple.  It's quick and easy to mix, needing only egg, oil and milk and unlike a lot of other gluten free doughs, it's not sticky which makes it easy to roll out, or form into shapes. We love it."
28958,B001ACNWY8,A1WG1NT9A77L01,Katy,4,4,3,1335916800,Very High Salt Content + Expensive - I Found a Solution,"My husband and I are both gluten intolerant and we watch our salt.  The buns are easy to make and tasty but they are too salty.  The nutrition statement for this product is very confusing.  The package states that the box of mix will make four buns.  The nutrition statement, on the side of the package, states that a bun contains 140 mg sodium.  But, when you read the fine print, you can see that the nutrition statement is actually based on making 10 tiny buns from one package.  So, using the package to make four buns, each bun would actually contain 350 mg sodium.  For anybody watching their sodium, that's too much salt for one bun.<br /><br />Also, four not-very large buns from one box of mix is pretty expensive.<br /><br />I realized that there's not much else in this mix except tapioca (manioc) flour and salt.  You add your own wet ingredients and, optionally, cheese.<br /><br />My solution:  I found many recipes on the Web, in English, for manioc buns or pao de queijo which is the Brazilian name for manioc buns.  The recipes that I found are esentially the same as the instructions on the Chebe box.  I bought Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour (four 20 oz bags for about $12.00) from Amazon.  To use up my remaining boxes of Chebe mixes, to dilute the salt level, in a bowl, I emptied the box of Chebe mix, added the same amount of Bob's unsalted tapioca flour (2 cups), and double the amount of wet ingredients required just to make the mix.<br /><br />The resulting dough was stickier than the original Chebe mix, but the buns that I made were incredibly good.  They tasted similar to southern biscuits.  They were hot and steaming with an excellent texture.  I baked them in an ungreased stoneware pan and they did not stick to the pan.<br /><br />After I've finished my remaining the Chebe mixes, I'll attempt to make more buns by using the rest of my Bob's tapioca flour with the same proportions of wet and dry ingredients that the Chebe mix uses.<br /><br />I'm not an experienced baker - does anybody have any idea how to make my lower salt dough less sticky - more oil, more liquid, more flour?"
28959,B001ACNWY8,AZEZCS62C8PGP,Amora Rose,4,4,5,1322524800,Love this stuff...with a little modification.,"I found this to be a little too doughy if I followed the actual directions. Here's what I did for a crispy, delicious crust every time:<br /><br />Roll out as directed.<br />Place in oven (at temp on package) for ten minutes, without toppings. I used a pizza stone.<br />Flip the dough over -- so that the top, slightly crispy side is now the bottom -- and then put the toppings on.<br /><br />Best gluten free pizza dough I have tasted yet!"

I figured out that Chebe had changed it's formula when trying to make them one day.  I followed the package directions as usual, & got a gooey, sticky mess that would not roll out into tortillas.  Then next time I made tortillas I used 2 TBLS water (1/2 the amount called for), 2 TBLS olive oil & 1 egg & omitted the cheese.  This mixture seems a little dry, but once kneaded it works perfectly!  As one reviewer said, Chebe is changing back to the original formula & if it were unchanged, I would have given the mix 5 stars.  My 6 year old is also gluten intolerant & allergic to corn & he loves these topped with cheese to make cheese crisps.  Fry the dough & you have a great base for Navajo tacos or tostados!"

It seems however, that along the new packaging (the cardboard boxes as opposed to the older version packed in bags) the recipe was changed as well - for the worse! Now it has this weird, medicine-like chemical smell to it! Awful, just awful. At first I thought that it was just a single lemon among the 2 8-packs I bought, but every other one was just as bad. I gave up after using using a few packages and threw out the rest.<br />I recently tried buying from another source (vitacost), and here we go again - same thing!<br />I don't know if it's the recipe or maybe they changed the source of their ingredients, and I really hope they go back to the original version, cause this one is just bad (to put it mildly)."

First, it grows relatively fast compared to other trees. Second, trees germinated from seed will produce fruit in 2-3 years. Third, it is easy to grow in sunny weather. Now, here comes the best part, the suggar apple fruit is AWESOME!!!!!, and likely it will become your favorite fruit after you eat it. So down to business, how do you grow the tree? Get a small pot with good soil (rich in nutrients), and put 4 seeds next to each other and about 3 mm or so deep in the soil. It is important that the seeds are covered by the soil but not deep into it. Next, water your pot+seeds. Important, these seeds like rain water and germinate fast with it.

For those that are familiar with this spice, nough said, and for those that are not I can only ask you to try it in your gourmet cooking. You will find many different reviews on it on the net, some filed with blessings and some filled with warnings. This plant compatibility is very specific, so to evaluate you need to try and decide for yourself. Nobody said that Eskimos and Somali will be happy on the same diet. To explain details: do you remember those small cubes of ""whatever"" with names like ""instant chicken soup"" or something like that? Well, those are now, by our modern standards made of things that you would be reluctant today to give to your dog. The funny thing is, they are still in production and people eat it. Here now is the real thing that started it all, natural, no nonsense, used by generations in many places like Argentina, China, India and few other countries for hundreds of years. It is called Fenugreek. Buy it, add one tea spoon to a quart of your soup before boiling, and find out how it makes your meal wholesome, healthy, custom and aromatic. If you prefer macaroni and cheese flushed with aspartame and saccharine US food this is most likely not for you and you should stick to your plastic burgers, but if you are searching for wholesome and specific flavors combines with medicinal values, this product will be just what you need in your kitchen. When I got it opened in my house, the ""oh my God..."" was what I have heard from wife and kids. Then I purchased 5 more bags and vacuum packed it. You get an idea.

The threads have a nice coarseness to them that are to be expected from top quality saffron.  Upon closer scrutiny we hardly found any hint of ""styles"", or in other words, the wasteful little white things at the end of the stigmas.  While the aroma gives a nice pungent and earthy smell, both my mother and myself still prefer the eau de toilette of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250QHZU"">Gathering Saffron</a>.<br /><br />Upon preparing a chicken kabob marination with this saffron, we were delighted with the marvellous color developing on the meat.  It was the classic golden hue with little crimson squiggles of the stigma remnants.  As effective a painter as this particular saffron was, my mother did mention to me that the only drawback was the quantity in which it took to get the desired effect.  Therefore its potency may be outperformed by other higher quality saffron brands.<br /><br />Once our banquet was ready to be served and I took the first bite, I was lost in its tangy and tart flavors.  The chicken barely stood up to the pressure of the knife and was incredibly tender in my mouth.  It was near impossible for me to leave any piece of such a delectable plate unfinished.  Though everyone out there may not necessarily get the same exact results, you will be far from disappointed if you purchase this.  So despite the better alternatives out there both my mother and myself recommend this saffron."

It is sparkling mountain spring water with flavor; however, if you wish a sweet beverage, simple add one little packet of your favorite artificial sweetener (Sugar Twin, Equal, etc.) and it is a perfectly sweetened delight.  The berry favor comes out more with the sweetener. Warning, though, when you add the sweetener to this drink, it will fizz up a lot, so be prepared to put the screw lid on REAL fast or put the drink in a glass first.  I've gotten pretty good at putting the cap back on fast.  Anyway, this is good stuff.  They also make sweetened drinks with no salt or calories, if that is what you are looking for.  A+ in my book!"

It comes in several flavors, but my favorite is Berry.  I have always enjoyed carbonated drinks, but so many are too sweet.  Drink too many of those and you end up needing to diet.  With TalkingRain there is no such problem.  And if you don't particularly like plain water, this is the solution.  When my son-in-law tasted it I had to double my order."

But now that I've taken a trip to another natural food store -- the kind that carries food in bulk -- I realize it's the going rate.<br /><br />That said, I really love this red quinoa. The Eden Organic brand is much more tasty than the more expensive kind that I got at the bulk health food store. After having regular quinoa at a picnic last week, I must say that both of the brands of red quinoa have more flavor and interest than regular quinoa.<br /><br />I have two all-time favorite recipes now, one that mixes the quinoa with craisins, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, scallions and cilatro with a mustard vinaigrette (my own recipe). The other salad (on the Wegmans website) mixes the red quinoa with avocado, corn, tomatoes, scallions and cilantro in a lemon vinaigrette."

Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.<br /><br />This is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories."

Just recently I purchased a 4-pack of Izze Sparkling Blackberry. It's an assortment of concentrated fruit juices dominated by blackberry with added carbonated water. The label says 70% fruit juices. This is not your average fruit-flavored soda pop, folks. This is real fruit juice and with no added  sugar. The taste is delicious and the blackberry stands out real nicely. The drink has a lot of natural sugars, but you don't get that sickening sweet taste I associate with so many of the  cheaper soft drinks. In fact, the drink has a slight sour bite to it and it's very pleasant. This stuff is more expensive, but maybe it's worth it. Personally, I'm looking forward to trying some of the other varieties.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water. The blackberry flavor is a blend of grape, apple, lemon, raspberry and, of course, blackberry. The mixture together seems to taste as much like blackberry as popping a fresh punch of blackberries into your mouth.<br /><br />The sweetness is the natural sweetness of fruit, and there is nothing added to make it artificial tasting. This is a super substitute for ordinary sodas. It's a much healthier choice!<br /><br />Very highly recommended!"

It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.<br /><br />The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!<br /><br />Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy).

I take half the can and add steamed broccoli or cauliflower to make it more of a meal. I've also used it to make a mexican chicken casserole. I just layer low carb tortillas, baked, diced boneless chicken, the soup mixed with a ""sofrito"" kind of mixture consisting of chopped peppers, onion, fresh mushrooms and usually chopped broccoli - saute in a bit of olive oil and add to the soup and on top I put shredded pepper jack cheese or sometimes some store bought already shredded Mexican cheese.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, price Amazon offers for this soup is comparable to Walmart + they'll deliver it right to your door for FREE!<br /><br />The only downside to this soup and the only thing that keeps me from eating it every day is the sodium content. There are 890mg of sodium per serving and 2 servings of soup per can so if you ate the entire can of soup in one sitting that would be a whopping 1780mg of sodium for one meal! I don't have high blood pressure or anything but I do watch my salt intake.<br /><br />If they could figure out a way to reduce the sodium of this soup, it would be perfect and I would eat it probably daily because it tastes so good and is fairly low in carbs.<br /><br />Despite the sodium content, I'm going to keep buying this soup.

I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or broth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes.

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""",21,23,5,1140480000,BEST KIND OF OIL WITH THE MOST IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS,"IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this brand exclusively. Here's why.<br /><br />""COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL"" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:<br /><br />-----*- Certification from the ""I.S.O."" - ""International Standardization Organization""<br /><br />-----*- ""Certified Authentic Product of Italy"", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions<br /><br />-----*- Natural product, just olive oil - nothing added<br /><br />-----*- Excellent full-bodied taste<br /><br />What are the nutritional components?<br /><br />A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable-derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta-carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17-ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.]"
29109,B0001FQV5C,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,David Bower,5,6,5,1298592000,The Only Olive Oil We Buy,We have used Colavita olive oil now for many years and have always found it to be an excellent oil for use in cooking and on salads. It has an nice flavor and is far superior to other oils we have tried in the past. I am looking at a partially used bottle as I write this review; I will also add we have a new unopened bottle in the pantry in reserve.<br /><br />Colavita Olive Oil is made in Italy by the Colavita family who has shipped this product to the USA for nearly 30 years according to the label. The label provides additional important information about this olive oil in that it is extra virgin and first cold pressed.<br /><br />I have read in a number of publications that these qualities are important when one is selecting an olive oil. My wife is our nutritional expert and always specifies this brand of olive oil only.<br /><br />As a husband and consumer of salads and various other assorted foods which benefit from olive oil I can testify that it has a great flavor as far as olive oils go.
29110,B0001FQV5C,AI0BCEWRE04G0,Stoney,2,2,5,1335830400,Does the Job,"QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an ""olive oil gourmand"", I'd describe Colavita as ""rich and smooth"".  Connoisseurs probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as ""nutty"" or ""fruity"" (but a ""civilian"" would never describe the flavor as nutty or fruity). It is not  spicy like Whole Foods 360, and NOT strongly ""olive-oily"" (i.e., ""herby"").  Colavita is an evoo (""extra virgin olive oil""---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means ""first pressing"".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words ""extra virgin"" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label ""extra virgin"" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, perhaps the best common grocery store olive oil, but is not quite a premium oil.<br /><br />Although heresy (comparable to suggesting fruit wines to a wine connoisseur) there are inexpensive alternatives to premium botique olive oils, including pumpkinseed, almond, sesame, and walnut oil.  I particularly love pumpkinseed oil as a dipping oil (by itself, no vinegar, and with a little salt). The following are examples---I can't vouch for the specific brands as they are different from what I use.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5OCFS"">Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil 8.45 oz</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JV3C82"">Pure Almond Oil 300ml</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB21A"">Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017O8F0A"">100% Natural Walnut Oil, Cold Pressed 16 fl oz (474 ml) Liquid</a><br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds depth and complexity to soups, sauses, stews, chili, casseroles, bean dishes etc. I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to such dishes.  Unless you particularly want the dish to taste ""olive-oily"" (I never do), cook the oil WITH the dish.  However, olive oil can ""go bad""---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil.<br /><br />""Cooking"" does NOT mean ""frying"" with ANY olive oil.  Because of the low smoke point (i.e., olive oil burns at a low temperature) olive oil is NOT suitable for frying.  That said, you can carefully fry an egg in olive oil at a low temperature (and honestly, good fried eggs swimming in good olive oil are wonderful).  But you can NOT fry meat nor deep-fry anything.  The best frying oil is peanut oil.  Canola is a good frying oil and is particularly healthy.  Like olive oil there is variation in the brands.  Peanut oil should be slightly nutty, but not peanutty.  Canola oil should be flavorless.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  Albeit probably heresy, you can subsitute other premium types of vinegar (such as wine vinegar, rasberry vinegar, or even apple vinegar) or fresh lemon juice.  I usually add a few drops soy sause or Braggs for saltiness and richness to the mixture. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W"">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good ""everyday"" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an ""everyday"" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a seed or nut oil or a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good ""everyday"" salad oil.  If you are not familiar with fresh citrus zest (wonderful stuff), the tool to use is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S7V8"">Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/Grater</a><br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of ""ordinary good"" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be subtle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with healthy vegetable oils.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.  Canola is better, but is essentially flavorless.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and just a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE"">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />It has been about a year since I've purchased Colavita because I can buy a better but obscure brand (Bella Famiglia) locally for $12 per 17oz bottle.  The 34 ounce tins of Colavita <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16"">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> are about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is still expensive for the quality, particularly with the shipping charge.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />The price of many items, including Colavita vary wildly on Amazon, sometimes from day-to-day.  Sometimes it is available directly from Amazon with free shipping, sometimes not---which makes a big difference in the total coat.  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it."

29120,B001EO7G30,A2EGZ2U58V550E,Tammie,0,0,5,1328313600,Much better than bagged teas,"I recently got into spearmint tea after reading that it may help with hormonal acne (which I have yet to draw a conclusion at this point). First, pure spearmint tea is pretty hard to find, most of those sold in stores are mixed with some other flavors. Prior to using Tao of Tea, I have been drinking Alvita's spearmint tea (this is sold at most health food stores), and the flavor really tasted like mint and has a very strong (in a good way) mint aroma to it. However, I wanted to try loose teas as I read that they are usually better (for various reasons which I won't get into).<br /><br />Well, let's just say that there's a world's difference between the two. Not only is this loose tea much STRONGER than Alvita's tea bags, but even the taste is different. I actually grew up eating spearmints, and my parents grow them in our backyard (I'm Asian-American), so I know exactly what the actual leaves taste like. I didn't taste any of that in Alvita's (and Pukka's 3 mint tea). It took me a while to realize that spearmint tea was the same spearmint I've been eating all my life! When I tasted Tao of Tea's, I thought to myself ""THERE'S that flavor I'm use to!""<br /><br />So overall, as far as which one is ""better"" for you, I really don't know. However, I can say with certainty that this loose tea definitely tastes like actual spearmint, and not just, well...mint (like the kind you get in candies). Ironically, I actually like Alvita's taste more because it tastes like the commercialized mint we're all used to. However, without a doubt, Tao of Tea (I have not tried other loose tea brands) is more ""authentic"" tasting, so I'll continue using loose teas rather than bags.<br /><br />I mix this spearmint tea with loose green tea that I buy at the Asian supermarket (this mix is generally called ""Moroccan Mint"" apparently). Using Alvita's, all I tasted was the green tea, but using TofT's I actually taste the spearmint a lot more....<br /><br />Note: this review is mostly a comparison of bagged teas vs. loose teas. I don't mean to imply that the Alvita brand itself is inferior."

These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!  What a rip off!!!"

When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.  Kuddo's to Great Northern for a fantastic and consistantly GREAT product!"

I got the Paramount Entertainment popcorn maker with the 6 oz kettle.<br /><br />Here's the right way to pop this corn in the 6 oz version, take exactly half of the three ingredients and put them in and THEN when they are done do the other half.  No more 60% old maids anymore, thing is the bag seems sized to the 8 0z hopper and its just too much for the 6oz at once so alot wasnt popping.  Doing half at a time changed everything, very good popcorn!"

It gets the 3 stars just because of everything being pre-packaged.  I didn't care for the flavor of the popcorn and found it not buttery and overly salty.  Will try to not dump all of the salt in next time.<br /><br />I found a better alternative was using a product called Butter-it which I purchased a gallon of through a local restaurant since it is sold by Sysco. It is a soybean oil base so it's liquid. Use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 heaping cup of kernals and if you want add a splash of salt and it is the best popcorn I have ever had....well, it is the same as in the pub I got the oil from, but still the best."

I was afraid it was my new popper so decided to try it in my old Stir Crazy popper.  This time there was about 1/4 of unpopped kernels but at least a full cup of poorly popped corn (tiny, tough pieces).<br /><br />So I tried some old Orville Redenbacher's I had in the pantry in the new popper.  Almost all of it popped with only about a tablespoon of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The flavor of the Great Northern was wonderful and what DID pop was crunchy and not at all soggy.

It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.

To make, just follow the instruction on the packet by pre-heating the pot then dumping the contents in.<br /><br />The packets are divided into a solid oil side and a kernel/salt side.  If you want to reduce the salt content, Just pinch the bottom of the packet where the salt is, holding some of the salt back from going into the pot.

Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of ""Old Maid"" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $."

I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat.

We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil, popcorn, and buttery salt).  That was our fault because we didn't read the instructions due to excitement.  But our first batch was still very good (a little salty because we added the salt mix last).  We made another batch two days later and it was awesome.  This is as close to theater popcorn made in our house ever.  It was really, really good.  Every kernell popped and it was a perfect balance.  We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER buy microwave or store popcorn again....We will be placing another order very soon.  I almost forgot to mention that we bought the 8oz bags.

Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more.

As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter.

However, I still really wanted ""movie theater"" or ""carnival/fair"" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1/2 stars"

We purchased a large 4oz popcorn machine for our game room family movie nights.  When it first arrived, I wanted to try it immediately.  So, I bought some Orville's at the store and I was disappointed with both the number of popped kernels and the taste.  After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.  Our family only uses about half of the salt flavoring and can not tell a difference in quality of the taste.  My son says it tastes better than at the movies.

Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.<br /><br />When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I searched and read tons of reviews on Amazon and finally decided to order this brand.<br /><br />MY GOD! This IS it! With my first batch, I was blown away by the taste. This tastes exactly like the movie theater popcorn. If not better because you KNOW its fresh.<br /><br />First: The 2.5 ounce packet is enough of a serving for a person. I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you'd get at the theater. I had to share. haha.<br /><br />Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.<br /><br />Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the ""solid"" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix. All at the same time.<br /><br />It takes about 2-3 minutes before the popping starts but it'll pop up a TON of popcorn. And again, the taste. WOW! This is the popcorn I've been looking for."

This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!"

I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy.  The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch)<br /><br />My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops.<br /><br />The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper.  There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits.<br /><br />If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these.<br /><br />The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines.  They say just don't use the oil.  Are you kidding me!?!?  It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's ""movie theatre"" taste.<br /><br />Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb.

My wife loves popcorn and can eat a whole large tub all by herself...but this 4 ozsize packet could easily feed 3-4 people for movie night and completely fills my Stir Crazy popper.  I dont melt the oil like some reviewers said to do since it arrived solid...I just pour all of the popcorn first spread out over my popper and then squeeze out little blobs of the oil here and there over the popcorn.  Worked perfectly and I had maybe 2 unpopped kernels.  The popcorn was very large and fuffy just like you get at the movies.  When the popcorn is done I sprinkle a little of the salt then shake the popcorn around, sprinkle a little more, toss again then put the rest on...turned out perfectly and I am not sure why some people say it tasty overly salty?  Perhaps they are just dumping it all on?  This is fine salt made for popcorn and it sticks to the popcorn very well so I would do what I did and just pour a little on to the top of the popcorn, shake the bowl, put some more, shake again and so on so your popcorn is unformely covered.  The popcorn is spot on like the movie popcorn and I love the taste.  I would stick with the 4oz size and get a Stir Crazy popper...they are great and cook pretty much all of the kernels thanks to the little arm that slowly moves around on the service to keep the kernels spread evenly and to help coat all of the kernels with oil so they pop perfectly.  Oh..and the popcorn is just as light and fluffy the next day...I didn't even cover it.  I would highly recommend trying this popcorn and I will continue to buy this brand only from now on.  I have tried all of the gourmet brands at the local stores and this beats it by far...and the ease of use makes this a winner.  Cut the popcorn and oil pouches and put in your popper...when popcorn is done, cut the salt pouch and sprinkle, toss, sprinkle, toss...enjoy :)"

All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Amazon, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive. Then I discovered Great Northern's Great American popcorn.<br />Not only was the Great American popcorn cheaper in price, but by comparison, the six-ounce package I ordered was larger than the similarly-packaged Whirley Pop at 5.5 ounces. The taste was probably about the same, although psychologically it tasted better to me because of the better value.<br />I probably went a little overboard, but thanks to the special 99-cent shipping at the time, I purchased three 24-count cases.<br />Each of these packages produces a whole lotta popcorn, which if not eaten right away, is still really good a week to 10 days later.<br />Just a great value for middle aged people who could use a little great-tasting ruffage in their systems!<br />Gotta go; feel another batch coming on!!!"

No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels, yes there are unpopped kernels. I think there will always be unpopped kernels. The trick to good popcorn is to turn the heat off when the popping slows. That's where the unpopped kernels come from. I suspect you could get less unpopped kernels if you like burnt popcorn. As for the taste, I think the taste is pretty close to the theater popcorn. The only difference to me is no hot butter. If you want to go EXACTLY like a theater, buy one of those hot butter melters like the theater has. Otherwise it is a great tasting popcorn. The 8 ounce packets give you a lot of popcorn. I believe I remember the packets for the 8 ounce machine saying it has 10 ounces of popcorn in each bag. Great American popcorn from this store seemed to have the best price I could fine and (in my opinion) is definately better tasting than other types of popcorn."

Now I am glad that they weren't in stock at the time, because it seems you get more bang for your buck with the 8 oz packs. They are only about 10 dollars more than the 4 oz packs, but you get twice as much product!<br />As far as taste, the oil and salt gives a spectacular taste to the popped corn. It isn't exactly that movie theater taste, but it is darn close. I mean lets be realistic, copying that theater taste is hard. But nevertheless, the taste is wonderful. I only use about 1/2-3/4 of the flavored salt because I think using all of it makes the popcorn too salty for me. The quality of the kernels is excellent. They pop quite big and aren't too chewy. If anyone has used cheap kernels (like great value), you know it can ruin popcorn.<br />I use the packs for my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35"">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a>, so I have to divide the contents in half. Half of the pack will fill up the popper easily, and I just keep the other half in a ziploc until I want to make more. I eat popcorn frequently, so it doesn't stay in the ziploc long, a few days at most. I'm not not sure how long they will last opened, but storing them safely should be fine.<br />Overall a great purchase!

When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.

You're looking at a guy whom has a motorized movie screen, projector, sound system, actual 4 head soda fountain and candy display.  So, matching the popcorn was a large task.  Initially I was stuck with buying popcorn and peanut oil.  Ya, it tasted good but no where near movie theater popcorn.  Then, I found Snappy Snappack's and Great Northern.  Greath Nothern was my first purchase.  I challenge you to read all the reviews on here.  I can assure you that those whom say the popcorn is too salty are correct.  The salt comes in a powder form mixed in with the seeds.  If you're careful you can separate the two with some effort.  Personally, I've gotten used to the salt but I can tell you that it is very salty.  The freshness wasn't a factor.  I have no doubt that others have gotten less than fresh popcorn.  Here's a warning:  when your package arrives, BE CAREFUL.  Don't just slice into it to open the box.  The people from amazon literally grab about 20 of the packets and drop them into a box.  I was at a city event where they were giving away free popcorn and snapped a picture of the popcorn they were using.  Snappy SnapPack: [...] This was not overly salted and tasted more like theater popcorn than great northern I think but they're both a toss up... it's super close.<br /><br />If you're unsure how big your kettle is... go by this: the 2.5oz is only good for one person.  The 2.5oz kettles are the ones you see like this:[...]<br /><br />You've seen them at places when you're out and about.  So in retrospect I should have gotten the 4.5oz one.  I have one of those small nostalgia popcorn cards.  2.5oz will fill up a large popcorn bucket about halfway.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this pre-packed popcorn is that it pretty much pops all the seeds.  When I used to pop popcorn from walmart popcorn and peanut oil it'd only pop about 50% of the seeds... the remaining seeds would fly out of the popper.<br /><br />There are some on here that talk about the buttery/oily mixture not looking fresh.  It does come as a semi-solid.  You don't need to kneed it, however.  Simply empty it into the kettle and it will melt on it's own.<br /><br />If you have any questions I'd love to answer them.

My wife bought me the Great Northern Little Bambino tabletop popcorn machine for Christmas, and I ordered the 24-pack of Great Northern popcorn packs because they were compatible with the machine and had consistently good reviews.<br /><br />We decided to take the popcorn machine for a test run during our NYE party, and the popcorn was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had.  It was just the right combination of salty, buttery and fresh, and it was a cinch to make.

The popcorn is great and the convenience of having pre-measured packs is very handy, it lowers the risks of contaminated product and guarantees freshness. However, something is wrong with the case I received. I just went through my remaining stock and threw away another 5 packs that were leaking oil. I then washed the oil mess off of what was left and tossed one more that wasn't sealed on the popcorn. This is after I tossed 7 away a month after buying the case. I had started organizing my pantry and noticed oil everywhere, the source being the corner of box of popcorn. Not a fun clean-up job. I had forgotten about it until today, when I had noticed oil all over again.<br /><br />The bottom edge of the packaging seems to weaken and develop points that ""crack"" open.<br /><br />So out of my case of 24, I've thrown away 12 and used 3, that's ridiculous in my opinion.

You've made popcorn at home, both on-the-stove and the microwave type, and it is missing ""something"".  This popcorn isn't missing anything.  From the tropical based oils to the carefully measured popcorn salt, this has it all.  It tastes exactly like the popcorn you get at the theater.  I've read a few complaints here that this popcorn is too salty.  I don't agree.  In fact when I make it, I add the full amount of oil and salt but withhold about 1/4 of the kernels to amplify the salty greasiness.  When I pop this corn the entire house fills up with that awesome ""movie theater"" popcorn smell but without that nasty microwave undertone.  The price was great, the product rocks, the shipping (even to Alaska!) was free, I can't really think of any constructive criticism for this product.

The other reviews all state that the popcorn once popped is really salty. I did not have this experience and quite on the contrary found it to be not salty at all.  This might be due to the difference in popping machines.  In the stir crazy when I poured the popcorn/salt side into the machine the salt all fell into a pile.  The stirring arm on the machine probably wasn't able to move the salt around like in a kettle type machine.  I also feel that the package does not include enough of the oil to make the popcorn really flavorful.  There was plenty to pop and flavor it but I think I just prefer more oil in my popcorn.  Lastly, the kernels while tasting pretty good did not pop as big as Orville Reddenbacher.  They weren't as fluffy and were more dense as well.  On the plus size they did not have a lot of husks to get stuck in your teeth like the ""Gold Medal"" brand I've tried recently.  Overall a pretty good product to use in the Stir Crazy.  When I get a kettle type machine in the near future I will definitely be trying these packs again to see if there is a difference in the taste based on the type of machine."

This is a perfect pack for 8oz poppers, everything is pre-measured.  My wife really likes that fact that the the corn, oil and salt are all partitioned separately on these packs.  That way we can control exactly how much salt goes into the batch for popping.  Reducing the amount of salt by half still gives us great tasting popcorn.  I can vary the amount of salt in each batch based upon the preference of the people that will be eating the popcorn.  Everyone is happy this way.  Try doing that at a theater concession stand!"

I got one of these for Christmas, and now I wish I got a bigger model, at least a 4-oz. popper.  The little tub loses too many kernels during popping.

These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn."

All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a breeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.<br /><br />Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.

You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term ""natural and artificial color"" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No ""best by"" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you."

29552,B000PDY3P0,ASY25YMTIC2A9,Steve,1,2,3,1306800000,Varying Freshness Ruins What Could Be Great Popcorn,"My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand."

After reading some of the reviews about the quality of the popcorn, I chose to give it a chance, price being one of my primary reasons for ordering and the automatic re-order feature.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  Only about 2/3 of the kernels pop and of the ones that do, the popped corn is very small in size.

Johnson,4,13,1,1317427200,Saturated Fat Nightmare,"With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets."

I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel."

We got introduced to it when I bought my wife a true popcorn machine (Great Norther 4oz Chaplain Popper and Cart). The popper and popcorn have been a wonderful addition to our home for the last 4 years and I have no plans to change any time soon.<br /><br />The simplicity of the popcorn kit packaging is great. Premeasured popcorn, salt (with butter flavor), and oil (which is solid at normal ambient room temperature make this such an easy job of making popcorn any time we want it.<br /><br />Turn on the kettle and let it heat up for 3-5 min. Squeeze out the oil and add the salt. I will say that if you use all the salt, it's quite a salty batch. We have found that using about half of the salt is about perfect. Wait till the oil is heated through and then add the popcorn. Pull down the kettle lid and wait.<br /><br />Part of the fun for us is the magic of making our own popcorn. Our kids just can't not watch the machine do the work.<br /><br />Now if one wants to complain that not all the kernels pop, I would argue that it's likely a combination of both the popcorn and the dimensions of your popping kettle. Do we lose some kernels? Yes (about 10%). Do I care? No. And why don't I care...<br /><br />The TASTE and Quantity! Even with loss of some kernels, this 4 oz package will feed 2 adults and 2 kids (5 and 2) for an entire movie. Just the perfect amount for us too. As for the taste - I don't know how anyone can eat any other popcorn once they've tasted Great Northern. I simply refuse to eat the microwave popcorn that we might make because we just don't want to clean the popcorn machine after use. The secret to that amazing, delicious, and addictable popcorn taste? Coconut Oil. It seems like such a simple ingredient, but the popcorn flavor that it helps to generate is simply amazing.<br /><br />The price is extremely reasonable too. And when I found that you could sign up for Amazon's subscribe and save, I signed up immediately. What a way to keep our machine fully stocked with the most authentic flavored movie popcorn ready for our weekly family movie night."

When following direct instructions off of the Great Northern product you will be left with 20-40% kernals unpopped which is VERY disappointing.<br /><br />The fix for this is to only pop half of the contents (salt, oil, and kernals) one time around and then to make a 2nd batch with the remaining half. Annoying? Yes. But this will reduce your unpopped kernals from 20-40% remaining to about 5% or less.<br /><br />This brand taste amazing but I will botch it a star for this small issue."

I used to use a hot air popper, and will be going back to that method. The popcorn isn't terrible, but I didn't think it was great either.  This popcorn has a bit of a manufactured taste.  I prefer the hot air popper with melted butter on it.  I also find it easier to control the salt when I use it from a shaker."

I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over.

The coconut oil is in a solid state, which it should be.  Once it hits the kettle it melts.  You heat your oil, and then add the popcorn and salt.  I do recommend putting the popcorn and salt together in a scoop or something for ease of emptying into the kettle (if you have a popcorn machine), otherwise it gets messy.<br /><br />I read several reviews that using all the salt makes the popcorn too salty.  We didn't find that at all.<br /><br />There were several unpopped kernels, so I'm not sure if this is the popcorn or not being used to our machine yet.<br /><br />This is perfect for our 4 oz popcorn machine and leaves the whole house smelling like a movie theatre.

This full pack produces about the same corn quantity as half to three-quarter cup of Orville's.

If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.

I have tried to duplicate the taste by buying coconut oil, popcorn and flavacol salt flavoring.  Cooked it exactly the same.  The taste is close, but nope...not as good as this product from Great Northern.  Of course the final price is cheaper if you mix it yourself, BUT...the end taste is not as good.  I have tried the Act II buttery flavor popping oil instead of the coconut oil, and still the taste is not the same as this.  I often use Whirl butter topping on my popcorn, which tastes fantastic - but these bags from Great Northern don't need a thing as far as topping.  Trust me.

The only negative is this is too salty. I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un-popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.

Yes, everything below was true but it was no fault of the product. The KEY to kettle style popcorn machines is proper temperature. The process to get big kernels is simple and is as follows:<br /><br />- Let the kettle heat empty for 5 minutes.<br />- Put popping oil in kettle and let it heat for another 5 minutes.<br />- Put in popcorn and salt and wait for the magic to happen.<br /><br />All of the problems I was experiencing below went away when I followed the procedure above. Popcorn pops real big and fluffy. I'm all out of corn right now and will be giving the Chiefs Choice brand a try to compare the two.<br /><br />--------------------OLD INACCURATE REVIEW BELOW -----------------<br />I had read a few other reviews here on Amazon that said this popcorn wasn't very good (Coconut oil flavor) and I have to agree. I thought I could suck it up and eat all of it but there is no way I will be able to do it. It's just nasty plain and simple. I'm using a Paramount popper and it works very well.<br /><br />My findings:<br /><br />- Kernels pop real small and are very chewy. Not big light and fluffy.<br />- Overall taste of the popcorn is not very good. Popcorn has a nasty coconut oil flavor to it. I thought maybe reducing the premeasured oil to half would help but it still has a coconut oil flavor to it.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty bad and maybe I just ended up with an old batch or something because when you taste the popcorn you could swear that it's old. I'm hearing there is a brand called Chief's Choice and I will order some of that today and give it a try."

You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store."

If you use all of the package's ingredients, you might end up with popcorn on the salty side, but that can be adjusted by not using the whole content of the salt package.<br /><br />I have several people tasted this popcorn and they all agree that it tastes like movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I definitively recommend this popcorn."

I like the idea of the oil on one side and the popcorn on the other, very much like I remember the old TV Time popcorn from when I was a kid. I popped up the first bag, but I found there was way too much salt for me. The next batch, I clipped a small corner of the popcorn side off and removed most of the salt. Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie."

It's cheaper than canned, too, if you can find a local source. In using these to make recipes, I add the appropriate amount of base for the amount of water or liquid called for and do not add any salt called for by the recipe until the very end, when it can be added to taste.  I note the amont of salt added and record it for future use.  This is especially applicable in recipes calling for boullion cubes (horribly salty usually).  Of late, in talking with restaurant owners,I learned Minor bases a what many restaurants use.  The base keeps in the refridgerator seemingly forever.  Search the internet for sources or, better yet, ask your local restaurants if they use it and where they get their supplies locally."

He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken, and both are superb. They have a flavor that is identical to home made stock. The stuff keeps forever. Give any of the Minors bases a try and you will be sold. The only problem is the ridiculous shipping charge from Soupbase, the vendor. It's almost as much as the cost of the product."

I was already skeptical that such a small amount of dry ingredients could make a 1 1/2 pound loaf of bread and they just proved me right. It was so horrible and inedible that at first I thought the problem might have been my bread maker. Then I tried the ""Light Oat Bread"" recipe on allrecipes.com on the same exact setting and what do I get? a PERFECT loaf of bread with very little more effort/time.  Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of bread mix, or just look up a Bread Machine recipe on one of the several sites on the internet that have them, Buy 10-15 dollars of ingredients (instead of wasting nearly 3 bucks on this crap that gives you an inedible less-than-half-loaf) and that will probably be enough for at least 10 loafs of bread."

The best way to enjoy it, in my opinion, is plain/black. That way, nothing interferes with the flavors and you can taste each one distinctly - the black tea, caramel and vanilla (despite the name, the caramel is stronger than the vanilla) - as well as experience how they interact and balance each other. It truly is a harmonious blend.<br /><br />For an extra sweet, creamy treat, I sometimes like to add Half & Half and one sugar cube (about 35 calories total). It tastes amazing that way too, though the sweeteners do mute the caramel and vanilla a bit.<br /><br />Whatever you do, please do NOT add honey to this tea.

29735,B000GFYRIA,AOXMSGH15FT41,"TokyoPurpleDog ""TokyoPurpleDog""",0,0,3,1315699200,"""heavy"" flavor","The first time I had this tea, I couldn't stand it.  Had one or two teabags, mourned my purchase, and left the other 18 tea bags there.  I've just tried it again and I found it all right, so I think I can get through the rest, but it will definitely take time.<br /><br />The flavoring added to this tea is clumsy and heavy.  The tea bags themselves say ""natural & artificially flavored"" and say it has a ""rich, robust flavor"".  That's for sure.  Dunk a tea bag in a glass of unheated tap water (I drink all mine steeped in room-temperature water, never boiled) and you will watch the water immediately turn brown, whereas a higher-grade tea would need much more time to get anywhere near that coloring.  The aroma also is very artificial-smelling and way too strong compared to what naturally flavored teas smell like.<br /><br />Is this a problem?  Not necessarily.  You might be looking for a ""heavy"" tea that you can use as a step to wean your kids off of colas.  With some sugar, possibly some cream, this might be exactly what you are looking for.  In the same way this might also be a way to wean yourself off of coffee if, as a coffee drinker, you feel that teas are too ""light"".  Or you might just like your tea this way, period.  Just be aware of this when you buy it.<br /><br />I recommend the Dilmah brand, Caramel flavor, as being similar to this one but not as fakey smelling.  (Dilmah also makes a Vanilla, which I think is OK but not stunning.)"

Used them almost daily until I couldn't afford them anymore... went to the ""Rock On"" shot from Walgreens because they were much cheaper and I could the 6-packs 2-for-1... Been using them for over a year and I just saw these so I bought a bunch... at $1 a piece, they are the cheapest and were basically the same as the rest...  They work just as well as the rest.<br /><br />Ingredients are all similar, some minor differences:  this has an ""enzyme blend""...  this also has slightly more of the ""energy blend"" than others (the energy blend is a combination of Taurine, Malic Acid, Caffeine, among other things).  It has 0 calories, some other products do have a few calories.  This also has a bit of Niacin which can give some a slight tingly feeling in their skin for a few minutes... I've taken Niacin before and gotten that tingly feeling, but don't get that with this drink.  This also has a small bit of Sodium.<br /><br />The taste is the same as all the other energy drinks.  They all have a slight aftertaste.  I actually like Grape and Berry the best.  The Orange has always been my worst flavor in all the drinks.  Again, they are all similar.  There is no real difference in taste or in aftertaste.<br /><br />The effect of all these drinks is profound.  Not in a bad way, they make me much more productive at work.  I sit behind a desk most of the day and 1 of these in the morning keeps me alert and more focused throughout the day.  When not at work, I will usually be very lazy around the house, but take one of these, and I'm cleaning the attic in a few minutes, and planning my next activity while doing that!  I don't notice any crash, none at all.  Just don't take it too late in the day.  Anything after 5:00 or so and I won't sleep until well into the morning.  :-)<br /><br />I'm glad these are around.  My wife used to take B12 shots for energy back in the day.

In addition to this, there's free shipping which saves me time and a needless trip down to the pet store.  If you buy 4 bags, you're getting it for about $12 per bag, which is a fantastic deal.<br /><br />In terms of the snacks themselves, the senior version of these Teenie Greenies are great-- they taste just as great as the original (based on my dogs' ability to consume it in under 3 minutes) but they have a softer consistency.

I general keep at least half a box of it around at all times, because it is a wonderfully flavored tea that my friends enjoy and it is something they will drink no matter what particular blend I might be brewing for myself.<br /><br />With a little bit of honey, it makes a nice medium bodied tea for a cold night whose mint helps to open the sinuses and the soothe the throat. Cooled with ice in a tea glass, it is an extra refreshing drink that fits right in on a summer day. It is this versatality that demonstrates how well this blend is balanced. It tends to stay away from bitterness even on over steeping, so it is easier to adjust to a strength you like without having to resort to milk to round the edges.<br /><br />And, to better justify buying it the ""Amazon six-pack"", it has a good long shelf life and it keeps its flavor strong for a couple of years."

The moment you toss the bag in water and start to smell that intense aroma of fresh mint, you'll realize you've gotten not only a tea but an aromatherapy kit that'll have your whole house asking for their own cup.<br /><br />The tea itself is wonderful. You might not expect tea and mint to go this together, but they really do. The overall flavor that you get is a wonderful mouthful of mint flavor with just enough bitter tea to make it go down smooth. It really is a fantastic experience.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a downside, I'd say that the flavor is just a touch too syrupy. Anyone who's actually used fresh mint before will likely recognize this tea for what it is- an (excellent) mint syrup drizzled (deliciously) into a cup of tea. Basically, this is a really good approximation of mint infused tea, about as good as you could possibly expect from a bagged tea. For a product this wonderful you can't help but wonder what it would be like to have real leaves and brew them yourself. However, that's the trade-off you make for just being able to toss a bag in water and get your tea quickly. And having a tin of fresh leaves in this mix, you'd probably use it for the smell long before you considered drinking it anyway.<br /><br />In the end, this has instantly become my very favorite comfort tea. Especially if you're feeling a little under the weather, the smell solves a stuffy nose in no time. Definitely get a box and try this- maybe two boxes if you have other tea drinkers in the family, since they'll likely steal the first box for themselves."

Plantation Mint is a rich basic black tea with a fairly strong spearmint flavor.  One of my favorite moments with this tea is taking a nice deep whiff of the aroma from the tea bag right after opening the foil pouch, before I've placed the bag into the water.  It would be a bit too much for me to have this as my normal flavor for every cup (I drink two or three cups of tea a day), but Plantation Mint is one of several Bigelow flavors that I drink perhaps 3 times or so a week each.  Every time I decide to reach for the bright green Plantation Mint bag my mouth starts to water.  Wonderful stuff!<br /><br />If you're wondering how this compares with other Bigelow Mint flavors, I would say the ""mintiness"" is similar to that of the Bigelow Green Tea with Mint, or perhaps this Plantation Mint is just a wee bit mintier.  Both are good-- it just depends on whether you're in the mood for a cuppa black tea or green tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.

My only complaint is that I do think it is<br />completely misleading to call it plantation mint without stating somehow that black tea (and hence caffeine) is an ingredient.<br />I am always on the look out for something tea-like to drink that does not contain caffeine. I find decaffeinated teas/coffees to taste funny and like to drink something that has not been altered to be caffeine-free. When I see plantation mint I assume that this product is  made with only mint leaves until you read the fine print on the ingredients to find black tea is in it. This is the only thing that bothers me about this product which is otherwise quite nice.

It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6µg (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors)."

I can't stand drinking plain water so I few squirts of this stuff make it taste pretty good. See, I work full time and go to college full time... So a normal day for me is 2-3 cups of coffee then about half way through the day I drink a Rockstar or Monster. Over time I've become somewhat immune to caffeine so even after drinking all this I never feel jittery.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll give a quick run down of Mio Energy. It taste like Green Monster without the carbonation and has a slight syrupy texture found in shaved ice. The good thing about Mio is that you can mix it light or strong depending on preference. Sometimes I squirt some in my mouth because I don't mind the taste and it reminds me of warhead candies when it is concentrated. I think from reading the other reviews that the user put too much or expected this to taste like koolaid or something. If you read the contents you will know that it will have a slight flinstone vitamin-ish flavor to it. Mio doesn't give me a huge boost like a good cup of coffee might.

I use it only raw, so I can fully appreciate its flavor.<br />I was really pleased to see it here on Amazon, at a price that is slightly lower than in any local stores.<br /><br />What a huge disappointment it was to see, upon delivery, that the bottle was cheap transparent plastic.<br /><br />Decent quality extra virgin olive oil MUST be in glass bottles or at most cans (e.g. Carli oil has some big cans along with glass bottles), even better if dark glass, because light also deteriorates its quality. I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I've lived in Italy.<br /><br />I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.<br /><br />This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).<br />This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.<br /><br />You can google ""extra virgin olive oil plastic"" and you'll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste. But it is a matter of fact that, even if you cannot taste anything different, the oil deteriorates in plastic. Many other foods are perfectly fine stored in plastic, I am not against plastic at all! But not oils, especially the less refined (extra virgin) ones."

The ""regular price"" for a box of this cereal at local grocery stores is in the neighborhood of $3-4. Outrageous. I commonly see supermarkets offer it for $2.00 in their weekly ads. That's more reasonable.<br /><br />However, Amazon's regular price undercuts even the supermarket sale price if you choose the Subscribe and Save option.

I always come back to Folgers Classic Roast.  It is the perfect medium blend and the taste is rich, suberb and totally satisfying.  Great for the morning pick me up or any other time of day.  But coffee is getting expensive.  The large containers of all brands used to come in 39 oz sizes.  Then they went down to 33 ounces for the same price.  Now many are going down to this new 22 ounce size.  I am amazed in the stores at the high price of coffee now.  This Folgers coffee here on Amazon is an amazing deal for price and quality of coffee when you use subscribe and save.  You get three canisters, a total of 66 ounces, for $19.49.  It comes out even cheaper to what two 33 ounce used to cost in the store.  And my local store just had this 22 ounce size on sale for $8.99. For 3 that's $8 more than this great Amazon deal.<br /><br />This review is definitely about the superb Folgers coffee though.  I must add that I also find the 22 ounce size very user friendly for the coffee stays fresh longer due to the smaller size.  Same amount of coffee in 3 canisters rather than 2 for the same price.  But as always there are some sellers on here trying to rip the buyer off when Amazon is out of stock.  No coffee is worth the ridiculous prices some will charge.  $47 for this?  Be real.

I have tried other cheap coffees, but this one is by far better for it's rich aroma and taste.  More recently I started buying the smaller 22.6 ounce container whenever the grocery store has it marked at least a dollar lower.  The reason for this is the larger container can last me about two months.  Toward the last couple weeks, the rich flavor is noticeably reduced.  With this smaller size, I don't have to worry about finishing it before that happens.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this at the local  store if it is available in your area as it is a bit cheaper that way.  I can usually pick it up for about $6 each  at Homeland.<br /><br />Edited to Add- Due to rising prices.

While the price of coffees seem to be rising recently, I found Amazon's price for this coffee to be a little lower than the local grocer's prices and the convenience of ordering it is unquestionable.<br /><br />Community coffee was what almost everyone drank when I was growing up in Louisiana.  However, my parents were not Community coffee fans.  When we visited neighbors and relatives, Community coffee was always served.  It was almost always overly strong dark roast that had been warmed over several times and, frankly, I didn't care for it much either.  It was not until several decades later when Community began to market a better quality of coffee in whole bean form that I started drinking it and liking it.  The Private Reserve Louisiana Blend Dark Roast reviewed here is one of their better quality coffees and my personal favorite.  It's nothing like the burnt-out tasting Community coffee I remember from my youth.  This coffee is balanced, smooth and rich.  When bought in whole bean form and ground fresh, it's a great morning cup of joe.<br /><br />Now, Community Coffee Company has been located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, since it began.  The roasting facilities, to my knowledge, never has been located in New Orleans as a previous poster stated.  Community did open the first of several coffee houses in New Orleans in the mid 1990s, however, the coffee is not roasted in New Orleans.  Since Community Coffee is considered the Official Coffee of Louisiana and is served all over the state--including New Orleans--those who are unfamiliar with the state outside New Orleans may be under the misconception that it's New Orleans-based."

I placed a small pot with a lid on medium-high heat with some canola oil. I added the sorghum, and then kept the kernels moving. Amazingly, they actually started popping. I half-expected them to simply burn, but they popped quite nicely. Sorghum kernels are very small, producing a miniature ""popcorn"" that is slightly larger than an unpopped popcorn kernel. Popped sorghum has a heavier, fuller taste than regular popcorn. Best of all, there are no kernel husks in the end result... just little fluffy popped sorghum. I experimented with popping different quantities and found that keeping the amount limited works best. With larger quantities, a significant number of the kernels did not pop. However, this wasn't all that bad... as the unpopped sorghum kernels were very delicious as well, not at all hard or crunchy. The unpopped kernels had a nice toasted flavor, a lot like corn nuts.<br /><br />Sorghum is one of those ""wonder grains"", that is used for everything from making sugar, molasses, animal feed, alcohol and biofuel.

29985,B000GB25LA,A1CB7TWXNEWBPJ,"Dianne Mcpherson ""Dunya""",0,0,2,1198368000,Disappointing,The rooibos is fine but the Early Grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. Tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. I've had very fine rooibos versions of Early Grey so I know it can be done.
29986,B0087M00IK,AI6CFYRXAYVEN,Dawgs43,0,0,4,1341273600,Just a few more pounds,"I have been trying to lose those last 10 pounds that are so hard.  I had heard about raspberry ketones on Dr. Oz and had a couple friends taking them with success.  I have used African Mango in the past and had success with that so I thought I would try something that had both in it.  This product also has green tea, acai, caffiene, apple cider vinegar and a couple other things.  So far, it seems to be working.  It gives me extra energy with the caffiene and I've lost about 5 lbs in 2 weeks."
29987,B004V3SHFW,A1UTE8JJIL2MAL,Brooke Rangel,10,10,5,1319155200,SO GOOD!,These easy packets taste SO good! They are cheaper than the jelly belly brand if you just want to try them out and trust me they taste way better. I LOVE ALL THE FLAVORS!

So many wonderful flavors to try.  No need to store a bottle afterwards which is good also.  Thanks.
29990,B004V3SHFW,A2TOUMUWSN7FJY,mokan gal,0,7,3,1334707200,Good snow cones,The product will crush the ice but it takes a while to do it.  I bought this so I could make snow cones for the grandchildren and I think they are going to love it especially once the weather gets hot this summer.
29991,B001QXYRGS,A2OWR2PL3DLWS4,Love to Cook,1,1,3,1263081600,Not bad,"I was looking for a taste like the Stash tea Moroccan mint, but with organic ingredients.  This tea is not it.  It just tastes like mint to me- nothing special.  I'm glad it's organic, but I was hoping for a better taste than this."
29992,B000DZFMEQ,A3P70L7MF8L3L3,J. E. Pote,1,1,5,1268179200,Pamela's Bread Mix,"At last a really delicious bread mix that tastes like real bread.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and added 5 tablespoons of ground flaxseed.  I don't have a bread machine and it was a bit tricky to mix with my old hand mixer but it rose beautifully and baked up perfectly.  The smell of freshly baked bread was wonderful.  We couldn't wait and cut the loaf before it was completely cool.  No problem!  The loaf was moist and tasted like real bread.  Maybe the flaxseed and coconut oil helped.  The bread was fresh for days right up until the last crumb was gobbled up.  Sliced thinly, it makes great toast too.  I'm not a fan of those bean flours and this bread was much better than the others I have tried."
29993,B000DZFMEQ,A1ASH1LE6HZ3Y3,Linda M. Walker,1,1,2,1256947200,Dated,"I purchased a case of this bread mix because my daughter has celiac and I find it so hard to find products at a reasonable price. I have made 3 out of the 6 packages and only 1 turned out.  There is no date on the yeast packet so on the last one I finally decided to use my own yeast and that did rise properly.  My packs are dated May 22, 2010 but like I said the yeast has no date on it like other products I have bought.  My bar code is 93709 30060.  So needless to say when I thought I was saving money it actually cost me just the same price as when I show at the store.  I will continue to look for products on the website.  Thank you for letting me vent a bit."
29994,B000DZFMEQ,A32PVZEV0QTHMK,Manisha,1,1,3,1256515200,TOO SWEET,I thought this product would be more like bread...but its so sweet.  They have added so much extra sweetener for no reason.  I think if it was not sweet it would be more verstile to use.<br /><br />Only use is for sweet breads but not for savory breads or all the non sweet itms
29995,B000DZFMEQ,A1RRCP78CDDIOS,"Beth Wisser ""Beth""",1,1,3,1254268800,Not the best,I really like Pamela's baking mix so I tried this bread mix. So far I have only made pizza crust and it didn't turn out so well. I didn't rise well and it made really dense crust. My husband and I both found it hard to digest; left us feeling bloated.<br /><br />I'm hesitant to try it again.

It's the only mix I've found that makes great sandwiches and better yet, you don't need to toast the bread in order to make it delicious!!!  Try this mix if you're gluten intolerant or you want a very delicious bread.  It's good either way."

It smelled so good when it was baking that we had to try some ourselves.  The texture is a bit different than regular bread but it tasted great.  Her boyfriend was happy to be able to eat bread that does not taste like cardboard."

Buying via Amazon is both cheaper and easier thanks to the direct to the door shipping!  The mix works great in our bread machine and comes out perfect every time!  Our kids love it and usually eat half a loaf as soon as its done!
