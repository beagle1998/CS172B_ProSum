30001,B000DZFMEQ,A3QAHX0VWAYXCU,T Jones,1,1,5,1208649600,Awesome!  Strongly recommend.,"I've taken the gluten-free baking classes from the CIA and, although you're taught to make good gluten-free bread, this is much better.  Simply because it is so quick & easy.  You don't have to worry about the bread rising.<br /><br />Make sure you use a mixer.  If you try to mix it by hand, the bread won't rise properly.  Additionally, the pizza dough is great with diced olives, homemade roasted red peppers, basil & garlic - all in the dough.<br /><br />Finally, I'm also allergic to corn, soy, beans, nuts, and a ton of other stuff. So, unless I make it myself, this is my only choice (other than some of the Namaste products)."

I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.

My pre teen has Celiac and our kitchen is GF and we are always willing to try out different GF items. Our current bread standby is from Glutino and, while it is not perfect, my kids enjoy it - especially when used to make french toast!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8H4"">The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />The first four packs I made I followed to the letter. I was a little disappointed that the instructions on the back for using the bread mix for oven baked bread, bagels, pizza dough, cinnamon bread and egg free bread all stated in large bold lettering that it required the use of a heavy duty stand mixer. I don't have one and so those options were out for me.  But still, using the recipe for breadmakers turned out decent (if fairly flat) loaves. I made the basic recipe and the sweet bread. The instructions state that you should make this on a Basic White bread setting instead of the Gluten free setting on your breadmaker and that is what I did.<br /><br />(Note that if you are buying this mix to bake in your oven, the package states that you need to use a stand mixer!)<br /><br />My child said that the bread was okay but that it had a wierd texture and taste to it. I think the texture was due to the grainy nature of the 3 rice flours in the mix. The flavor, I think, is the Millet flour which tends to have a bitter aftertaste. Millet does have good nutritional value but if the flavor turns off the child from eating it what is the point??<br /><br />Anyway, I still had two packs to go so I decided to tweak things a little. I made the sweet bread recipe again but this time I used butter instead of oil and baked it in my Zojirushi breadmaker on a programmed gluten free program and Voila! The bread rose beautifully! It had a light airy feel to it; a bit spongy - almost like a cake. The 1/4 cup sugar covered up the bitterness of the millet, home made butter (could use unsalted) instead of the melted oil made it rich - and it tastes almost exactly like Challah bread!<br /><br />So if you are just GF and not CF as well, this is a sure fire way to make some excellent sweet egg bread.  And if, like us, you miss your Shabbat Challah, this bread mix will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen!"

I've been fortunate to find the desired items in my local shopping area, but that effort is tarnished with too much time, travel, and occasional disappointment with product availability. Amazon came to the rescue with quite a few gluten-free cooking and bakery items advertised on their web pages. Now I've come to depend on several of my favorites, most importantly Pamela's Wheat-Free & Gluten-Free Amazing Bread Mix. I love it, and I say that while speaking from the experience of being on a gluten-free diet for over nine years. I've been baking bread at home all that time, using various recipes having around a dozen ingredients. The results with a few of those chosen recipes have been quite good, certainly a far cry from the comparable  products in the stores. For some time now I've baked with the bread mixes offered by several out-of-state companies. The results--passable but nothing to rave about. Then I discovered Pamela's products in local stores and couldn't believe the high quality, great taste and density (2+ pounds per loaf) of the amazing gluten-free bread mix (just four ingredients plus the mix to bake it).  Now I opt for that continually and the big surprise came when I saw that Amazon.com carried it on their Web site. More satisfaction developed over the fact that Amazon delivered a six-bag box in just a few days and with a  very satisfactory and competitive price that changed me from a struggling on-the-road shopper to a stay-at-home baker. Thank you Amazon--for the bread mix, cookies and oatmeal, all gluten-free."

I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden brown color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was!  The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame! =("

Lately I've been using the seed bread recipe, although I don't care for poppy seeds so I just put in extra sunflower seeds. I always add extra sesame seeds for the top. When it has fully cooled I slice it up and freeze it so it stays fresh and ready to use for toast and sandwiches. This mix also makes surprisingly good bagels!

Just super heavy, and like week old regular bread.  Kinda crumbly.  It takes like an hour and a half to finish cooking on the inside.  I guess gluten free bread is so bad, that this is the best we could come up with.  I must say it had a nicer aroma than the other bread I tried, but I just am not impressed.  I'm going to bake another loaf, and pray that I did something wrong the first time.

I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon.

My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I've tried has been beyond disgusting.  I've been to health food store after health food store and haven't found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law's bread machine and fired up a loaf.<br /><br />Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you've eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It's a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn't have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!<br /><br />I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as ""real"" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you're the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the ""On"" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.

Since we found this mix we have stopped experimenting with the various GF recipes we have collected. It does it all and is easy to make."

But the real issue I had with this bread is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.<br /><br />I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.<br /><br />I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red mill<br />gluten free bread (which is also tasty).

(Till now, I always had to eat a GF sandwich hunched over the sink to catch the crumbs.)  It makes great sandwiches, toast, cinnamon toast, toasted cheese sandwiches, BLT's, etc.  I even made a hamburger bun out of some of the dough.  The only failure so far was French Toast: it didn't absorb much of the egg and milk mixture.<br /><br />For Easter, I made a turkey with gluten free stuffing and gravy.  It was heaven on earth!

The yeast packet is included in the package, but is not mixed into the flours.  2 eggs and 1/4 cup of oil are needed to complete the recipe. The label has recipes for pizza crust, bagels, and pie crusts using the mix.  I have not tried these applications, so I cannot comment on them.<br /><br />I love this bread. The mix makes a large loaf (I use the mixer method and bake it in the oven; I don't use the bread machine).  The bread has a nice, soft texture.  It is not crumbly at all.  I have shared it with several people who eat gluten, as well as others who cannot; everyone likes it.  The flavor reminds me of a soft whole wheat bread, and is slightly sweet. I keep the bread at room temperature, and it tastes great even without toasting or heating first - an amazing feat for GF bread.<br /><br />The option for making rolls (in a muffin tin) with this mix is wonderful -finally, a roll that looks ""real"" and tastes good. I let the loaf bread cool fully before cutting it, but the rolls can be eaten piping hot, right out of the oven.  The rolls can also be frozen and reheated when needed.<br /><br />Try this bread - it is so much better than any of the frozen pre-made GF bread out there."

If they would have posted ""many people"" having allergic reactions, we may have thought twice about trying this product and could have saved him a lot of severe pain plus the approx. $4000.00 for the procedure he had to have done. He has had no reaction to the Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix and the pancakes are really good. Good luck to those trying this product."

I've eaten many other gluten-free products (and occasionally some gluten ones) and have never run across this effect with any other flour blend. Before I figured out this bread was the culprit, I thought I had a stomach virus.<br /><br />In skimming reviews here and elsewhere, I've found a good number of people have had the same issue. I wrote to the company and they said that some people have trouble with sorghum and millet flours. The sorghum flour is the first ingredient, so that may be the case. I do think this bread dough is more glue-like than gluten products, so that may be part of the trouble. The Baking & Pancake Mix and the Brownie Mix seem to be fine for me, they have different ingredients. You can also make a loaf from the Baking & Pancake Mix, there is a recipe on the Pamela's web site - it's just not as nice as the Bread Mix loaf.<br /><br />Very disappointing."

Well, 5 people were ""supposed"" to eat the beer bread and only 1 was ""supposed"" to eat the rolls, however the rolls were a hit with all of us.<br /><br />My gluten free daughter was in heaven, not having a decent bread product since she was diagnosed about 6 weeks ago.  The rest of us knew the rolls weren't exactly like our usual wheat based ones, but they didn't have a weird texture or after taste and were quite yummy anyway.<br /><br />We mixed the eggs, oil, water, yeast, and packaged mix in the mixer for 3 minutes.  I used an ice cream scoop to fill 15 muffin cups.  Let them rest/rise for an hour and baked for 23-25 minutes.  They rose beautifully and got a delicious looking color.<br /><br />Next time, I am going to underbake most of the rolls so they can be frozen to be thawed and reheated at a later time.<br /><br />Wow...I am so excited she doesn't have to live the rest of her life without delicious bread :)"

The oven method seems to produce an 'exploded' top, which I assume is from the yeast rising too quickly?  Either way the bread turns out moist and stays fairly well in the fridge.  I always toast the bread on a dark setting which produces a light tan, probably due to the moisture in the loaf.  Every GF bread I have tried has always seem to be much better tasting toasted and I think that is the rule if the GF world?<br /><br />I also use this for pie crust (you do not use the yeast).  The pie crust has 3 variants:<br /><br />1) Standard - 2 sticks of butter<br />2) Flakier - 1 stick of butter and 8 OZ of shortening<br />3) Non Dairy - 1 stick of margarine and 8 OZ of shortening<br /><br />I've tried both the standard and flakier versions and both turned out well.  Never had a complaint about my pies (yet!).  You may want to warm up the bottom crust first or it may be a little raw, but I have also had that happen on regular pie crusts.<br /><br />If you do try the pie crust - make sure you put the mixture in the fridge for a bit to ensure it is cold, otherwise it may be too sticky.  I roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper that has a quick spray of PAM applied.  Makes the transfer to the pie plate a snap!"

Doing it that way, my ""I-only-eat-bakery-breads"" hubby LOVES it.<br /><br />I use a Zoji bread machine on the QUICK course setting, LIGHT crust. This keeps it from being overkneaded or baking out the moisture. Then I cool it completely on a wire rack (uncovered).

Super easy to bake in our West End Hi Rise bread maker - simply follow directions and the loaf comes out perfectly.  It has a very child friendly taste - I disagree with other reviewers that say it is too sweet, it is similar in taste to a ""normal"" honey wheat loaf - and MOST IMPORTANTLY NO HORRIBLE SOUR AFTER TASTE like we have found to be the case in some of the other mixes and store bought loaves we've tried.  The texture is denser than ""normal"" bread similar to other GF breads - almost cake like - BUT it is tasty, moist and NOT CRUMBLY like other GF breads. The slices kept perfectly in a vacuum-sealed Ziploc bag in the fridge for 5 days.  I took two slices out of the fridge and put them in the microwave for 10 seconds on each side to get it back to room temperature since my son has never liked to eat cold bread.

I made it my bread machine on the dough setting and baked it in the oven following the package directions for oven baking.  It got very brown at 60 minutes (rather than the 70 the package suggests) so I took it out.

I could have eaten the entire life, haha!  But I found the next day it was not as good, even with retoasting it in the oven.  It was very heavy and dense and had a strange bitter taste to it.  Because of the dense texture though I think this would work really well for sweet breads.  I tried using it as a pizza crust and it was just way too heavy and overpowering of more delicate flavors like cheese and mushrooms.  The flours used in this were a little hard on my tummy too.

I simply follow the instructions on the bag, set my machine to medium 2 pound loaf, and in two hours I have the best gluten free bread ever.  It is soft, light, and springy.  It has a slightly sweet taste, probably due to the sorghum flour.<br /><br />If you try this, I highly recommend using the bread machine. I've had a lot of successes baking it in the oven, but I've had a few loaves explode over the sides of the pan, making for a not-so-aesthetic-appearing loaf.

The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56"">Quest Bar 2.12 oz.

At even Whole Foods, I typically pay $1.69 per bar, and get a slight discount for buying an entire box. Once you add shipping to Amazon's prices, they are more expensive online. Also, keep in mind the season when ordering them. All of the coatings had melted and were stuck to the packaging, then fell off in pieces when opened, due to having melted during shipment. But if you can get them locally, give them a try. There are many flavors to choose from, though most stores seem to only carry a few.<br /><br />Those people who claim they are awful tasting probably haven't tried other protein bars that are low-carb and gluten-free, and expect them to taste like candy bars or high-sugar bars that may be more tasty, but are also full of ingredients that render them nutritionally useless."

I've got to say, these certainly don't taste like white chocolate, but they are delicious. I think the branding in this company just decided to call this bar white chocolate, because thinkthin has another chocolate flavor and this one has a more complex flavor symphony working for it that would deter from the title of simply chocolate.<br /><br />I do wish they had a little more nutritional value in them, but I shouldn't ask for too much when flavor is more of my concern in a protein bar. They've got a little calcium and iron, so I'm happy.

30358,B005DDCKJ8,A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,Angela Evans,0,0,5,1297728000,one of Think Thin's best,"I'm a pretty big fan of Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter bar and wanted to try some of the brand's other flavors; White Chocolate Chip sounded delicious.  I have to say that this bar has replaced Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter as my favorite.<br /><br />Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip bar has an exterior white coating and a tan center with mini chocolate chips.  The exterior coating is more similar to a vanilla flavor than a white chocolate flavor.  For those that enjoy sweets, this may be your ticket to fulfilling your sugar tooth and obtaining a decent amount of protein.  Note: The exterior coating is sensitive to heat so if you will be in warm temperatures, expect meting to occur.<br /><br />I found this bar to be moist and flavorful compared to the typical protein bar and even compared to Think Thin's other products. I'm not saying that you cannot taste the protein.  I don't know if that is something you can escape without massive amounts of sweetner.  It is a very edible option.  The ease of consumption is also appreciated. With some protein bars, you have to worry about chipping a tooth but this bar was easy to consume.<br /><br />These bars can really help you ride out a period of hunger.  I sometimes use them as breakfast bars and can go three to four hours before I feel like a snack or other breakfast item is needed.<br /><br />Think Thin's White Chocolate Chip protein bar has an admirable amount of protein and is sugar free.  Those with sensitivity to sugar alcohols and soy should probably pick another protein bar, however, because the bar contains both."

I went to Whole Foods and asked the employee working in the health bar area and she told me that this brand was a favorite for high protein, no sugar, and pretty good tasting.  She also told me that Chunky Peanut Butter and White Chocolate Chip were the favorite flavors.  I bought them both and liked them and saw that Amazon has them cheaper so I bought a box of each.  I was concerned when I read the reviews on here and someone said the bars were stale/ old/ not fresh, so I was prepared to send them back if need be. I checked the expiration date and they expire in a little more than a year.  I checked the wrapper of my bar from Whole foods and it expires 11 months from now.  Amazon's is fresher, go figure!!

I place a portion into a glass jar to serve from and left the remaining product in the re-sealable pouch.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks the aroma disappeared and so did the truffle taste in the salt from both the glass jar refrigerated sample and the remaining product in the original pouch.  Because the list of ingredients did not identify the source of the truffle flavor, I have concluded that this was a sea salt product with added artificial truffle essence, the laboratory created aroma of truffle that contains no real truffle bits or natural flavoring.  As such I believe I wasted my money on what is now a bag of sea salt whose saltiness is on the bland side as well."

It's not because I don't want to do so, but because if I don't like a coffee I am too frugal to dispose of it.  However, since I love Magnum Coffee Roaster's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee, I decided to give their Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie Coffee a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this flavored coffee.  The coffee is a nice medium roast.  It is smooth and leaves no acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I could not distinguish any vanilla flavor or any nut-like flavor in the coffee.  Nor could I isolate any pumpkin pie taste; rather, the primary flavor was of cinnamon.  Since pumpkin pie has more complex spicing than simply a cinnamon flavor, I was puzzled by the choice of name for this otherwise very good product.<br /><br />This is a very good choice for anyone who likes spiced beverages, and who wants a good cup of flavored coffee.

In fact, I was quite impressed with it, considering my husband only paid $1.00 for it! To start with, its a little sweeter than the 65-70% cacoa chocolate I'm used to, but the sweetness is not overpowering. It has more of a rich, dark milky flavor, much like a cup of dark chocolate cocoa. I didn't notice any grainy texture or taste, in fact, it was quite smooth and silky-like. While not the ideal chocolate to compliment a glass of Cabernet, I think it would make an excellent baking chocolate for classic desserts such as chocolate pie or homemade brownies. And for those who think it taste like wax, perhaps it would make a perfect dipping chocolate for strawberries or apples? I'm giving it 3 stars, and if it came with nuts, I'd give it 4!"

To the people who can't drink milk this is Great ,the reason it's great is because it is one on the original chocolate candy formula's .Originally All chocolate was dark chocolate ,There was no milk chocolate ,without milk and lactose being used as a filler the normal chocolate had 85 to 90% chocolate solids per volume .<br /><br />Milk was added by the Swiss and used as a filler .Way back in the 1880's they found that when you combine milk with chocolate you could reduced the chocolate content in the candy .Milk chocolate was sold as a less expensive form of chocolate because the manufacturers like Hershey could sell a chocolate with 25% Cocoa content for a low price and still make a huge proffit as the could make 3 to 6 cheap candy bars by reducing the Cocoa in each bar .<br /><br />So in America we eat cheap chocolate because we see it as the normal type of chocolate candy. This product is Bitter sweet Dark chocolate and is very dense not waxy like a Hershey candy bar .<br /><br />To the High end consumer this is the Same grade as expensive Belgian Chocolate if sold as a Bitter sweet Dark chocolate,This product does not normally contain Whole milk ,Milk solids,Lactose, calcium extenders,Milk protein or Animal by products such as animal fat,animal derived protein or bulk extenders which alter the favor of real chocolate<br /><br />While this product may contain  a minimum of 40% Cocoa solids(the main favoring and ingredient in chocolate)It is the best chocolate product produced in Poland and A true value to chocolate lovers Any where!"

It's nice to be able to transport one or two bags without having to touch them directly with dirty hands.  Other brands leave the individal bags naked and have a nice sealed liner in the box, which is really handy if you plan on wandering around with an ENTIRE BOX OF TEA.<br /><br /> - Each bag has a dipping string/tab attached to remove the bag from your cup.

It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not.

As far a a amazon rating though it is, in my opinion, a good (not great) tasting cereal and has a good bit or fiber and protein.

Post has the flake portion down pat - large flakes with a nice crunch. In contrast, the Kellogg's flakes are smaller and more fiber-tasting. (As an aside, the Kellogg's flakes work better than Post when using the cereal as an add-in for baking multi-grain breads or oatmeal cookies).<br /><br />But raisins are part of the equation as well. Kellogg's seems to have more raisins and, more importantly, they taste better - plumper and less chewy than the ones in Post.<br /><br />I usually get Kellogg's since I can live with their less than great flakes, and they usually cost less (good sales on Amazon, plus I can get the jumbo boxes at Sam's Club).

Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.

They contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California to try to trick people into voting against Prop. 37, which would require that genetically engineered foods be labeled. Raisin Bran contains GMO Bt corn and GMO sugar derived from GMO sugar beet. Both were developed and patented by chemical companies. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. It has been genetically engineered by forcing a foreign gene that makes its own pesticide into the plant DNA. Every cell of this plant is a pesticide factory. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. Both the sugar and the corn have foreign genes for herbicide resistance forced into their DNA. The plants are made to resist high levels of RoundUp. The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp, a chemical called glyphosate, has been linked to birth defects, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer and more. These GMOs have been snuck into our food supply without telling us. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled (including all of Europe, China, Russia, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India). In the US there is currently NO labeling law. The FDA does NOT require long term, peer reviewed studies to determine if GMOs are really safe. They let the chemical companies that patent these ""foods"" decide. How can this be when the FDA is there to protect us? WRONG. Just google Michael Taylor, Food Safety Czar and you'll see that he's setting food policy. When it suits him, he uses the revolving door to go back and forth between the FDA and the largest chemical company that is patenting and trying to monopolize our food supply.

This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright.

Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.

Not everyone has the same taste buds but I found it to be a wee-bit on the bitter side, even at the largest cup. Would I buy this again: yes! I don't mind it being a wee-bit bitter but in my opinion Colombian coffee should be bold & smooth tasting not bold & bitter. I know Diedrich Colombia coffee has that bold & smooth taste I prefer; there must be something in the word ""Lively"" that Folgers put on this box to indicate that it may be bitter.

A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good.

Nice Mix of Nutrients.,"I picked up a box of Wonderful Pistachios (24 1.5-ounce packets) on my last visit to my local Costco Store. They're a very nice pistachio. The roasting is perfect and they're lightly salted, just as I like them. The little bags are handy for snacks and lunches and are a way of keeping me in check when it comes to eating them. The pistachios are nicely opened and I've only found two ""uncracked"" so far. I save them in a pile and use the nutcracker on them when I get enough. The sodium content of a serving is quite modest relative to a lot of other nuts. The fat and calorie content is fairly high, but it's a less-harmful fat. The fiber and protein are moderately good.

I do not think the first review in 2005 was done by an employee, and that's not really a fair statement but rather an assumption lacking any real fact or evidence. It seems like a very small company that just enjoys making cheese straws and wants to share them with others. I sincerely doubt that, at the great price they are, the company even makes a ton of profit - which is a shame.<br /><br />Secondly, after tasting Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws for the first time this Fall, I will not eat anyone else's. I literally threw away a package of a VERY POPULAR cheese straw company that I received yesterday as a gift because when I tasted them, they just tasted bland and floury. I could not even bring myself to finish them. I crave Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws so much. (I recommend trying them with some Shiraz or other wine!)<br /><br />Our company gave out Aunt Lizzie's cheese straws as a corporate customer gift this year, and I bet that Aunt Lizzie will have a slew of new customers after that.

I will say the cheese straws are the best I have ever tasted. From the flavor to the crunchy feel in my mouth, I am addicted to Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. The negative? Customer service is non existent. An order that was placed on the internet was subsequently lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. Personally, I can count the number of times an email has been lost over the last 10 years on one hand. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number with each order and when asked for one after the order is placed the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. ANN, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future.

They take such minimal preparation that a serving of hot refried beans can be ready in a matter of minutes. And they're delicious. Plus, these beans pack a lot of excellent nutrition. They're high in protein and dietary fiber and low in fat. The sodium/potassium ratio is about even and a serving is only about 120 calories.

I'd read that Californians who had moved with their jobs back east to the Carolinas would have people visiting California ask ""Do you want me to bring you some beans?"" -- they're that iconic and that good.

I find them to be much more like other freeze dried snacks as opposed to the consistency of a dried apple.  Because of food allergies, we're quite limited in what fruits our children can eat and what can be added to them.  It was truly a relief to find organic apple snacks without a list of additives and other fruits mixed in.  While others may prefer different types of fruits mixed together, we need snacks that are limited to the fruit that mentioned.  For example, fruit leathers often include pear even when they're listed as grape fruit leather.  These are what they claim to be...apple!<br /><br />The second most important aspect for us is that these snacks are from the USA.  Unlike the other brands, these are not from China.  We make every effort to avoid toys from China, and definitely have no interest in eating food from China.<br /><br />While these are extremely expensive, amazon makes them more affordable than my supermarket.

I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind."

A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange.

Garlic is too strong for me (I love garlic in other forms though).<br /><br />I was hesitant to try these initially because I'm not a big fan of pepper flavor in chips, but am I glad I did!

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere."

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next."

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

They are perfect for snackers who crave salty crunchy things more than sweets.  There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)"

No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack.

They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.

The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture-wise, they remind me of ""Munchos"" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read ""rice flour"" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or ""filling"" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn.

These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding. I would give them 3 stars if my review was just based on taste; I'm giving 4 stars because I really want to like them because they're more healthy and I can think of lots of healthy foods to use them with - why not tuna,, egg salad, etc?"

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."

The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips."

So, when I got the opportunity to review them, I was so excited to try them out. Unfortunately they did not live up to any expectations that I had from the good things I heard about them. The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable. It doesn't add anything in my opinion. Despite my experience these chips have good reviews. That tells me that I just need to try other flavors. This one needs improvement."

This was my first time trying Popchips, and I loved eating them, the texture is great.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the size of the bags. It's like they are only half-filled, or the bags are twice the size they need to be. It makes it look like there is more in the bag than there is.<br /><br />Note that although these are '100 calorie' bags, each bag has 16 carbs.

They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!"

It has the tang of a regular chip with BBQ flavor, but has the light and non-salty taste of a healthy snack. I literally had to hide the bag to prevent eating them all in one sitting. With a nice glass of sparkling water, they are a true treat and a great alternative to the usual processed chips we've all come to know, love, and mindlessly consume. I truly suggest you open your mind and buy a bag. These were absolutely wonderful to have as a late night snack, a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, and something to share with the children in my life.

You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

At first I thought they would be like Pringles,"" which I don't care for "" but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide."

No artificial flavors. No saturated fat. No gluten ingredients.<br />Popchips are thicker than ordinary chips. They're crunchy ,zesty, tasty, and not overly salty. I like that there's no greasy residue on my hands after eating some.<br /><br />The chips are uniform in size, strong enough to dip, and small enough to make double dipping unnecessary.<br />After sampling these for the first time, I'm looking forward to enjoying these great tasting and satisfying chips again."

I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light. They're air-popped instead of fried or baked and all-natural. You can pronounce all the ingredients on the list. Vegan, kosher, gluten-free, no cholesterol, no saturated fat, no trans-fats, low sodium (220mg or 6% USRDA), no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors, there's nothing in here for me to complain about.<br /><br />1 bag is only 100 calories (30 from fat), which is about 1/3 less than regular potato chips. I could eat the whole thing without feeling guilty. The salt and pepper taste is very pronounced and adds a really nice bite to the chips. When I was done, I found myself running my finger through the inside to pick up the remaining seasoning bits and crumbs.<br /><br />I've tried the BBQ flavor as well as several of the others.

The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, ""sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil.""

There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.

Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",0,1,5,1327708800,I loved them!,"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation."

The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty.

The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon.

Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

(BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list."

I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake ""healthier"" for ""healthy.""  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those ""truth in advertising"" points that annoys me so I mention it."

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.

These take a little longer to cook, but are definitely a great match for the broth.  I bought them because they are gluten free, but they make a great soup noodle in their own right.<br /><br />QUANTITY vs. PRICE:<br />I wish there was more in the bowl than what was provided.  This is what takes the product from 5 stars down to 4.  For the price, I wish there was more food - or for the amount of food, I wish it was cheaper.

I was so glad to find Craving Place pancake and waffle mix although I was skeptical at first about anything tasting good that was ""gluten free, wheat free, nut free, egg free, dairy free and bean free.""  My thought was, ""What's left to give it flavor?""  I was won over by my first bite of crispy/fluffy goodness. I've experimented with added ingredients over the course of the year.  My favorites are adding about 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon along with 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to a batch of waffle mix (since cinnamon is good for diabetics).  I just top the waffle with margarine and thus avoid having to use sugary toppings like syrup.  I can only eat 1/2 a waffle at a time bcause it does affect my blood sugar level too much if I have a full one.  I find the extra waffles last all week without refrigeration."

Thank you all very much for sharing your opinion on our honey. As you'll understand, this is always great for us to learn about! I hadn't seen these reviews before, that's why this is a bit of a late reply. Sorry for that.<br /><br />Honey Attiki is a multi flower honey, a blend of Greek honeys from the wild: flowers, thyme and coniferous.<br /><br />@ Tudor: I just wanted to assure you that our honey is as pure as it comes from the beehive. There are no processes involved that diminish the unique health and quality beneficial values of the honey, nor do we use any additives. It is a 100% natural, 100% pure and 100% Greek honey, with all the related benefits.<br /><br />Thanks to great periods of sunshine combined with unique landscape characteristics, Greek honey is highly concentrated. The honey is gathered from a variety of around 6000 different types of natural flowers, herbs and trees, 600 of which are only found in Greece.<br /><br />In Greece we have about 80% of the year sunshine. Besides the fact that this is obviously pretty great to live in, you also know that sunshine means health and healing. All this is what Greek honey represents. It is great for your health and it has so many benefits for your body and even mind (stress relief, against insomnia, to name some) that you really treat yourself on something exceptional when you eat Greek honey and Attiki, as the most popular honey from Greece, is celebrated for its great taste.<br /><br />If it interests you, Greek honey is one of the most studied honeys in the world and if you Google it, you will find quite some information about all the specific qualities and uses of it. If you like to know more about Attiki, you can always contact me: info (AT> attiki-pittas &lt;DOT) gr, to the attention of Jan.<br /><br />Sweet greetings from Greece!"

It is truly one of the last great tasting honeys of the world, with health benefits if imbibed in reasonable amounts.  This honey tastes very different than the typical, commercial and pasteurized junk you find on your mass supermarket shelves, so at first, you may be unsure about the taste.  Rest assured that not only is this honey delicious, with amazing flavor and notes- it is also one of the healthiest and purest honeys made by unique bees that differ from the ones in North America.

When I brew this Kcup, I use the maximum water amount (I have the mini brewer) which I believe is 12 oz...for me, this gives two large glasses of tea once I've added ice and lemon. I also cool the tea off before drinking...I realized that actually brewing it over a cup of ice significanly waters down the product (I believe it is intended to be that way) but if I cool it off, then I can water it down at my discretion, not add as much ice, and I end up with more tea from the Kcup.

Since no one food is perfect for every dog, I highly recommend trying a small bag first, and then see if your dog likes it as much as mine does.

In general salads are safe (except the croutons), but we have to watch the dressings carefully.  By bringing our own dressing my wife has found she can eat on the road and not get sick.  While the no calorie and fat free options are appealing, the Gluten Free aspect is wonderful for those who must eat Gluten Free. When you have Celiac, it's simple to tell if a food it simply labeled as Gluten Free or if it really is!  If it really is GF and also free of cross contamination, my wife doesn't get sick.  This dressing meets all her GF needs along with tasting good.<br /><br />This dressing has a nice consistency, tastes good and is about the right size to put on a Subway or Wendy's salad if you prefer your own dressing.  My wife takes this in her lunches too.  If you don't need the packets, you can save some money by buying a larger bottle and filling a small Tupperware type container to take with you.  You can also modify the portion size by pouring your own.<br /><br />In order of preference, our favorite Walden Farms flavors are:<br />Italian Salad Dressing<br />Ranch Salad Dressing<br />Chipotle Ranch Salad Dressing<br /><br />As a Calorie Free, Sugar Free, Gluten Free dressing this is the best ranch dressing we have found.  It's not as thick as Hidden Valley Farms and a little less sweet.  Hidden Valley isn't an option in our home due to our need to be GF.

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."

I did, that is, up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher, so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.<br /><br />The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai, so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.

The flavor is rich and the best part is you can make it as sweet or as week as you like. One scoop per cup is usually plenty. I mix mine with a little milk to for a more creamy texture. I've tried a few other mixes and some have had a nasty smell and after taste. I used to buy the Target brand in the green can but they discontinued that and now make it in a silver can and its one of those fake chemical smelling and tasting mixes...YUK.<br /><br />The only complaint about this is that 25% of the can is empty so you really don't get a full can.

It is my favorite chai and until I bought these two huge cans, it was something I enjoyed every couple of weeks when I was out shopping.  Knowing how expensive it is to order from a coffee shop, I thought it would be better to just make it myself.<br /><br />Making it at home, I use milk instead of water and only use about half of the recommended scoop.<br /><br />Once I got the cans, I looked at the list of ingredients.  Sugar is number one on the list and each serving has 24 grams of sugar in it.  (That's almost 70% of each scoop.)<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it definitely has caffeine in it.  One 8 ounce cup of this prepared chai has about as much caffeine as two 12 ounce cans of Coke.  After a short while, I noticed that the caffeine was starting to affect me- by way of headaches.  I don't really understand the company's claim of being 99.8% caffeine free when clearly it is not.<br /><br />While I think the flavor is great, I won't buy this again due to the caffeine and sugar content."

While it may be technically correct (I'm not sure how I'd calculate whether the can contains only 1% caffeine, and whether by weight or volume), I think it is misleading.  I use caffeinated products, but seek decaf for my son.  I do not feel that 65mg of caffeine per serving counts as ""caffeine free,"" and would suggest that this part of the product description should be amended or removed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I see that at least one other reviewer has noted the caffeine issue, and I will call attention to it, as well.

He chews with his back jaws and is able to flatten it pretty quickly and then somehow gets it out.  This used to last a day or two but is now only good for an hour or two.  If your dog is not a problem-solver, it can still be a good product but if he figures things out, then it quickly becomes a very expensive 1-2 hour event.<br /><br />Previous Review:  My young dog is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys (not people!).  He can deconstruct almost any kind of stuffed toy and he can EAT any size of rawhide treat.  Rawhide is a disaster for him because he chews off big chunks and then swallows them.  The rawhide doesn't digest well and the big dummy gets diarrhea.  I was actually worried he was going to get an intestinal blockage from rawhide so we banned the rawhide when we found this product.<br /><br />It is very hard to get the discs into the rubber treat ball.  I have to stand on them and even then they don't seat in very properly.  However, the dog has an equally difficult time getting the treats OUT.  He has to chew sort of sideways on this rounded treat using his back molars.  They must be tasty too because he keeps working on these and they last for days.<br /><br />We will continue to buy this product.  It keeps our pup busy, seems agreeable to his stomach, and compares very favorably to other chewy treats."

These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls. We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each. These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy. Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but they really prefer this flavor and the vanilla mint. The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger. Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats.<br /><br />Update: The malamute figured out if he sawed away at one side until about 1/4"" was demolished, that he could then pull the whole thing out and just eat it.

Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range."

The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste."

I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food.

The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.

Scherner,0,1,1,1348185600,"If Your Kids are Stupid Enough to Think Water is Cool When It's In a Bottle with a Cartoon Character, Then Fork Over Your Cash","Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."

I thought they were okay, but I wasn't in heaven over them and certainly don't have a craving for them. They are very buttery, but I find them bland and flavorless. I guess maybe that's what shortbread cookies are all about. These were a gift to my husband. I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy them.

My two cats all developed kidney stones and one died of CRF after eating this brand food for several years.<br />We have switched the food for our cats, and will never use any Hill's product for sure!"
31783,B00106TG9Y,A3TVZM3ZIXG8YW,christopher hayes,2,8,1,1291420800,"Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more","This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Like other reviewers, I received a few dented cans, although only one was so badly dented that I hesitate to use it.  I have used the pumpkin in pie and pumpkin bread. It is a bit less dense than the kind we are all accustomed to buying in the grocery store, but it is by no means watery.  I did add an extra egg yolk to the pie to make sure it set up.  The pie was somewhat wetter than my typical result, but it held its shape and tasted great.  This made excellent pumpkin bread.  My family has devoured almost a whole loaf since last night.

It lasts a long time (he only gets about 2 tablespoons a night), smells wonderful and I plan to use it in some muffins as soon as I get the time to make them.

I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin bread.  It is wonderful pumpkin...dark orange, tasty, full of pumpkin goodness.  However, a few days later I removed the rest of the cans from the case to put them in my cupboard.  From the middle row, right in the middle of the case, there was one can that was SO badly damaged, that I am afraid to use it for fear of me and my family getting sick from bacteria.  Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes.

During the great pumpkin shortage of 2009, Amazon seemed to be the only place that I could find canned pumpkin and so I decided to take a chance.  It is perfect!  It is creamy and smooth with no additives.  When it became available for Subscribe and Save, I jumped at the chance.  Buying it locally was a bit cost restrictive at about $3 a can.<br /><br />What do I use so much pumpkin for?  I first learned the wonders of pumpkin from Hungry Girl's daily newsletter.

While refreshing my pet care knowledge, I read about folks using canned pumpkin for their dogs.  What the heck.  Gave it a try and it seems to help.  BUT!! now she won't eat her meals without it.  She's hooked on pumpkin--a pumpkin junkie.  Thankfully, with Farmer's Market Organic, I can rest assured that, like her cat food, there are no harmful additives.<br /><br />Sadly, I've been unable to get the pumpkin from Amazon of late.  I even resorted to that other named brand and the difference is startling:  stringy and off colored.<br /><br />Fortunately, Farmer's Market Organic pumpkin is available in my local stores once again, however I am going to miss the Subscribe & Save option."

31907,B0062A87HA,A8YPV1O2FHEJD,Tracy,0,0,4,1284076800,A good price for a good product.,"First, I want to review the product itself. I've used this brand of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market brands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the ""ready to ship"" flat of cans that were pre-packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way. I wouldn't have hesitated to purchase the cans off of a store shelf in this condition since the product is in very short supply, so it isn't a problem for me."

I ordered this because the price was comparable to non-organic brands in my local supermarket. Thrilled, I did 'Subscribe and Save'. I fully expected the expiry to be soon, as is often the case with Amazon, but the stamped date was a flmost 3 years from now, yaayyyyy! It is wonderful pumpkin, and a safer can than most brands, double yaayyyy! Not one dented can, another surprise. However, now that I set up auto-ship, the price zoomed up. That seems to happen a lot. I'll probably cancel if it doesn't go back down a bit when I need more."

However I took the chance. Amazon is my favorite place to shop.  This is the  pumpkin that I buy at our grocery store.  It is for my 18 yr old cat and it keeps her regular. This is her favorite brand. Also I'm hearing that there is a possibility that canned pumpkin might be hard to find on the shelves after Thanksgiving because of the rains. So I wanted to stock up. I remember a couple of months ago  it was hard to find in some areas.<br /><br />I received the order yesterday and was a little scared to open it up.  But it was fine!! The cans arrived in great condition.  There was a tiny dent on maybe 2 or 3 cans (just like I might find on the grocery shelf). I was very happy with my order.  Maybe it has something to do with the warehouse it is shipping from.  I live in CA and Ontrac delivered it. I've been so impressed with Ontrac. Amazon has been using them alot lately.<br /><br />I went ahead and ordered 2 more cases and hope they arrive in the same condition.  The date on the cans is 6/2012. The price per can on Amazon is $2.36. In our store it is $2.99 and when on sale, maybe $2.50.<br /><br />I received 2 more cases that I ordered and they were in perfect condition.  Now I'm all stocked up in case it is hard to find pumpkin on the shelf next year.<br /><br />12/08/09 UPDATE:  I believe it matters on who is delivering the order.  I ordered one more case. For some reason this case was delivered by UPS (the others were all delivered by Ontrac) and some of the cans were VERY  badly dented and cannot be used. I asked for a refund.  No matter who is delivering these cans, Amazon needs  to put some protective packing around the cans so they don't get dented. I will no longer take a chance and order similar products on Amazon."

Dented cans, 36 cans purchased and no dents.<br /><br />4. Lastly, beyond the value it was organic with a shelf life on our cans into late 2013.

Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.

Libby's has disappeared from stores.  This stuff is the only brand ANY store is selling.  It tastes like dirt.  It really does.  There is no fresh pumpkiny flavor.  It is also watery, which changes how pie and cake recipes turn up.  Finally, I gotta wonder-if LIBBY'S pumpkin harvest dried up, where are these guys getting theirs from? A mystery"
31985,B0062A87HA,A2CGORRQGDEL37,T.C. Owens,7,7,1,1283990400,"Good pumpkin, BUT too many heavily dented cans!","I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  ""caveat emptor."""

Most in ways I can't imagine happened during shipment.

One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE - and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage -- otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.<br /><br />Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.<br /><br />That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.

I like this brand because it is not as pricey as those that are sold specifically for pets, and it is a solid consistency (not as loaded with water as some other brands), and it is organic (just makes me feel a bit better), and it is reasonably priced (especially with the 15% discount for setting it up as a subscription item).

If the top or bottom of the can moves in any way or makes a popping sound, the can's seal has been broken and air has made its way inside). The pumpkin tasted fresh and had a very succulent, moist consistency and it is organic.

As a result, we go through a lot of it. We usually use the Libby's brand which is readily available in our grocery store, but due to flooding of last year's crop it has been out of stock for a few months. Luckily the organic growers did not have the same problem. I find this product to be more finely pureed than the Libby's so it seems a bit runnier. However, my dogs love it. The only minor disadvantage is the cost. It is more expensive than the Libby's, plus I'm paying to have it shipped now vs. picking it up at the store.<br /><br />A number of other Amazon customers have complained about receiving badly dented cans. Mine arrived 100% intact. This may be a result of the unconventional courier used. It appeared to be some sort of private delivery service though I paid for the standard service.

This is not a Puree like Libby's Pure Pumpkin, it's more dense, a firmer molded pumpkin.  It has about 10 more calories per serving than Libby's and has higher nutritional stats in vitamin content.  I happen to like both consistencies but prefer organic given I use it almost daily in one form or another.

The really good kind that makes you glad the cups are small, and the not-so-good kind that makes you long for the kind your mother used to make.  This pudding falls in the second category.  This pudding is okay on an occasional basis, but the chocolate flavor seems a little off.  It is difficult to describe what I mean, but the flavor just does not quite have the power of home-made chocolate pudding.<br /><br />I have tasted a number of other pre-made puddings, and several of them are very good.  The vanilla and the tapioca are generally very good to excellent.  The lemon is also very good.  However, the chocolate seems to fall short in tast quality, and while I will eat it occasionally, if you have a choice between home-made and this one, choose the home made."

This is the stuff.  The Big Green Monster.<br /><br />As I write this I'm listening to DJ Splash and I'm about to start my second 16oz. can.  There was a time when I hated trance/dance music and didn't drink ""soda,""  but now the two seem like a marriage consecrated in the holiest of heavens.  By the way, it's only noon.<br /><br />My path to Monster Enlightenment was born out of my video game addiction.  Playing until 4am and getting to work by 7am was turning into a bit of a hassle.  Coffee can only do so much, and that's when I started to drink rocket fuel like a meth addict.  One can a day used to do the trick -- and best of all -- it satisfied my appetite too.  Who needs nourishment when you can get by on sugar and caffeine and a few vitamins sprinkled on top for fun?  I wasn't a tub before by any means, but I'm about 15 pounds lighter than last summer.<br /><br />But the days of single cans are in the past. I'm currently trying to ween myself of satan's nectar.  A 16oz can is around $2.35 at most stores, so if I have two a day it's pretty similar to if I had a moderate smoking habit.<br /><br />The withdrawl is pretty unpleasant, too. I'm not sure of the addictiveness of Taurine, but Caffeine isn't something to be scoffed at. Your body adapts to Monster's boost pretty quickly, and before too long your body expects it, longs for it.  It becomes harder to get through the day without it.  I have been known to drink it warm and/or flat.<br /><br />So why the five star rating?  Because this stuff is awesome and I love it.  I love it even though I'm probably going to end up with intestinal cancer because of it.  I also like the flavor the best out of all the energy drinks.<br /><br />Just be wary, drink it when you need it, not as a substitute for your regular drink. This is - by no means - a health drink.<br /><br />[...]"

What I have noticed is that I feel better, my skin is clearing up and I have lost some weight. THE taste is different. Yet, if you open your mind to the possibilities of the benefits, the taste is outweighed in my opinion. I did do 30 days and wait one week.

I'm not a picky eater, so I'm not the best person to ask about the taste, I say most things taste good. But I can testify to the efficacy of many of the ingredients listed here. If you like some of the other Yogi teas, you'll probably like this one to. It does have a kick to it (have you ever had fresh ginger?), but I like it, and I will continue to order it because it helps me relax and feel good."

I mostly drink plain black tea but when I want it decaf and I'm too lazy for loose tea, I go for Yogi :)<br />As for this particular combination, I found its taste pleasant but not everyone agreed with me on this. It has a strong-ish black-pepper-mixed-with-cinnamon taste and a bit of (lemony?) ginger. I'd say if you are looking for some herbal tea only for the taste of it, this may not be it. Yet, just looking at the ingredients list makes me want to drink this tea.. it just looks so healthy. So I'll keep a box around and alternate it with Skin Detox maybe, which has a much milder, rosy flavor to it."

It is definitely dehydrating and will make you pee alot, so be sure to drink lots of water, too.<br /><br />Drinking this daily at bedtime has been really beneficial to me. Even if it's just a placebo, I love it. In combination with lots of vitamins, exercise, and good nutrition, I'm seeing the weight come off a lot faster than before.

For me the smell is kind of off-putting and I was sure I wasn't going to like the taste. But I'd already bought it so I decided to brew a cup anyway just to see how it turned out.<br /><br />I love adding fresh lemon slices or small 'cutie' mandarin oranges to my tea for sweetner (because I don't use sugar), and so for this tea I added the juice of one mandarine orange (along with the actual little orange pieces, love having them and seeing them in my tea!) And it turns out as much as I hate the smell (still do...) I love the taste! With the fresh mandarine oranges it really gives it a taste reminiscent of apple cider (weird, but true, and really good). Also, I absolutely hate black licorice, but I really like this tea, so I'm thinking it won't be a problem for others who dislike licorice as well...<br /><br />It's a very strong tea with bold flavors and is a really good replacement for coffee, at least for me. :) Don't be afraid to try it. :)"

It started with reading about Jillian Michaels water mixture that had dandelion root tea in it and I came across the yogi tea. I figured I'd give it a go from the good reviews. Although I can't say anything about the detoxing effects as I haven't used it long enough...I can say the taste is just fine. I am not typically a herbal or licorice liking person. I usually hate the taste. This tea isn't bad at all. I brewed it in a small amount of hot water then made it into iced tea (it's still hot out!)

The pear taste is not as strong as the RW Knudsen's sparkling pear, and the carbonation is on par with the other Kristian Reg&aacute;le drinks I've tried, though it's a bit more mild than the Pomegranate, and much more mild than the Lingonberry. It's light bodied and the citrus acid gives it just a tiny acidic kick. Comparing only the taste, and not the carbonation, it's terribly dissimilar from Martinelli's.<br /><br />The mild, yet pleasant taste makes this easy to pair with. It'd go with many, many different foods, though especially with cold, light foods, like salads, pitas and hummus, or cheeses.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, 7 out of 10.

Bought a large bag of the extra-large caramel style, the red, and the purple. My wife and I agree the purple is the best. It is more dense and not chewy at all. It has a richer flavor. The red was second place, great but just not quite as good with poor popping. The extra-large was third. The extra-large was large and popped great, but it lacked the flavor and was slightly chewy. You could see that it would be great for caramel popcorn, but not for simple butter and sea-salt popcorn like we prefer. Still, they were all good.<br /><br />The correct way to pop: High heat on canola oil in a pot. Add 3 kernels. When they pop, add rest. Cover with spatter shield, this will keep the kernels in but let the steam out.<br />Enjoy!"

One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.

I would normally steer clear of Chef Boyardee but the reviews were good as well as the price so I thought I would take a chance. I have no idea how this could have a 4.5 star rating, and I have to wonder what the culinary standards are across the US.<br /><br />Let's start with the sauce. First of all it's brown, thin, insipid, and lacking any tomato taste. There's some tasteless gristle in there that I guess is supposed to pass as meat. The ravioli themselves have a texture I've never before encounted in pasta. I have no idea how they hold together being that soft. I wasn't expecting al dente, but this is at the other extreme. It's mushy and slimy. It didn't even know there WAS a stage of pasta like this. It has no texture to it at all and becomes a gummy, pasty mess in the mouth. There looks to be generous filling but I have no idea what it's made of. The generous 'meat' filling shown got me to buy it but it has no taste of meat at all.<br /><br />I don't know how any mother with a conscience can feed this to her kids.

It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement.""<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, ""When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day.""<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that this review is for the six-pack of 16-count boxes, an excellent value overall. Compare it to other six-packs of this same tea on Amazon to make sure it's the best value, though, as they are always cheaper than buying the single boxes, but some are better deals than others.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

It's certainly VERY convenient, but I do think the taste suffers a little as a result.<br /><br />I think when these are gone, I'm going to keep trying other brands.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll"

32265,B000RI8GI8,A29TOYHBJ80ZOZ,Shawn Poland,15,19,5,1325030400,Its supposed to burn your throat!,"I read many reviews of this drink, and the same people said the same thing...that the drink burns their throats.  That is exactly the intention of the company, to ""imitate"" the affects of actual Cocaine.  To cause a throat-burning sensation while it gives you an intense, euphoric energy high with no crash.  Its quite a gimmick, I admit and I searched relentlessly to find a can just based on that.  Well, was I impressed when I tried it?<br /><br />To date, I have ordered 4 24 packs of this from the site.  I just ordered a 24 pack 2 days ago, so what does that tell you?  I have found a few loose cans in flea markets and instantly jumped on them.  So how would I describe the product personally?  Apart from the throat burning sensation which indeed takes some getting used to.  The flavor is unique, unlike any energy drink on the market today.  It has a slight cherry taste, mixed in with hot cinnamon and a hint of bubble gum sweetness.  The cinnamon flavor is dominant and most recognizable out of all the flavors.  If you can drink this down without pausing, you have a powerful throat because I still can't do it.  Just make sure you drink this served chilled, because drinking it warm would be kind of gross.<br /><br />Now for the energy buzz.  What a buzz it is, too.  I have drank hundreds of energy drinks and I usually don't go a day without an energy drink.  I have a high tolerance.  5 hour energy does nothing for me, I fell asleep twice after taking them.  Redline Xtreme barely does anything at all.  The first Cocaine I ever drank, I was seriously buzzed.  My body was shaking and I had a numb, tingly sensation, but it felt amazing.  I didn't have a ridiculous jittery energy high, but a focused high where I felt I could focus on video games for the rest of the night or write a long essay.  I didn't get the bouncy knee, it was mostly all mental energy, which is what an energy drink should supply you with.  I am definitely sticking with this drink as my energy drink of choice.  Whenever I have insomnia and have to wake up early to go somewhere, I drink one.  When I have a long day of walking, whether it be out shopping, to a mall, or flea market... I bring one with me and slam it down.  It is the perfect ""get out and do stuff"" drink and perfect for your hardcore gamer, such as myself.<br /><br />So stop the whining about a burning throat sensation, realize that is the intention of the company and order yours today."
32266,B000RI8GI8,A3MTS3CA5MO1T4,Brian,12,15,5,1286236800,Wow!! Liquid Atomic Fireball Candy! Great!!,"Delicious!! Yes it's just like drinking liquid Atomic Fireball candy.  I should say ""sip"" since I CAN'T<br />take a swallow. It would blow my head off. So much caffiene it gives me a headache if I drink it too<br />fast! This will wake you up! Wish I could find a local source. I'll be getting much more of this."
32267,B000RI8GI8,A21KWS6DAES8YW,Trevor McGee,3,4,3,1333756800,Cocaine is overrated and gimmicky.,"First thing's first: The taste. It tastes sort of like generic cough syrup, minus the medicine-like taste (if that makes sense). It doesn't taste like any other energy drink I've ever had before. So it's unique in that regard. It's not necessarily a good thing, though. I would have to say that as far as taste goes, I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Secondly, the ""spicy, burn your throat"" gimmick. It's just that, a gimmick. It doesn't taste spicy so much as it just makes your throat itch. I assume that the slight ""spicy"" feeling comes from the drink being cold, but if drank warm I'd assume it would taste like camel urine. All it really did was kind of annoy me, it didn't really add to the experience. Not that I was looking for the real cocaine experience. *wink wink*<br /><br />Thirdly, while it has a high amount of caffeine, it didn't give me quite the kick I was expecting. It woke me up a little, but it didn't do much else. But then again, I drink energy drinks like water so I have a high tolerance. Though I would not recommend it to others, if you value your health.<br /><br />My girlfriend said that the caffeine effected her more than it did me. She got more of an energy boost without the jittery feeling you may get with supplements such as 5-Hour Energy. She said that she enjoyed the flavor of the drink, so you have a second opinion there. She said that she had experienced the taste combination of cinnamon and strawberry. She enjoyed the ""spicy""-ness of it but agrees that it wasn't as strong as expected. Even though she liked it, she would only be interested in buying this again if more cans were added or the price was lowered.<br /><br />Now, here's where I would have to suggest not buying this product. Whether I liked it or not. It is TOO. *BLEEP*ING. EXPENSIVE. About $30 (including shipping) for six 8.4 fl oz (250ml) cans. You're better off buying something like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NCTXZY"">Power Horse BIG 16 Energy Drink, 16-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>. It costs about the same, maybe a couple bucks more, and you get 24 16 fl oz cans. And in my opinion, it gives you more of a boost, tastes better, and you get more for your money. It's a cheap alternative to the more well-known energy drinks (i.e. Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, etc.).<br /><br />All in all, mediocre experience, mediocre drink, too costly. NOT. WORTH. IT. Save your money. Don't fall for the hype like we did."

I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success.

32368,B001AJ1ULS,A5L504DA1XL6F,Christian Stone,0,1,5,1267660800,Good deal on a great item!,"Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day."

But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.<br />So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.

My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients."

It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon's prices and delivery can't be beat."

Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.

In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]"

I heard it all--and very little worked for me in the slightest.  I spent my days being miserable and feeling sick as anything.  But when I was visiting a friend, she happened to have a package of Gin Gins and offered me one.  I was already chewing on raw ginger to help things, so I figured it couldn't hurt.<br /><br />Rarely has anyting tasted so good as that candy did to my morning sick stomach!  Sweet, but not too sweet, with enough of a gingery bite.  One hard candy could last a while and keep the nausea down.  The first thing I did when I had a chance was order a whole case of the things!  After that I always had a bag tucked into my pocket book throughout the first months of my pregnancy.  Unlike raw ginger, there was no preparation time involved, and the candy is much more pleasant to eat and easier to share with others. (I still like raw ginger and ginger tea, though).  Since then, I've recommended and shared my stash of Gin Gins with several pregnant friends--and they've given me positive feedback as well.<br /><br />Gin Gins also makes a chewable kind--but that's hard on the teeth and can pull out a filling if you're not careful! Plus it's a sharper taste than the hard candies, so it may not appeal as universally.  My only regret is that there doesn't appear to be a sugar free variety of these on the market, and that is something I could have used.  Still, all in all a great investment and one of the most useful things I bought for my early pregnancy.  Beats saltine crackers any day!<br /><br />Enjoy! ^_^ Shanshad"

We also use the beef marinade all the time with beef short ribs in the crockpot and the herbal mustard rub. I use that on my tofu scramble with lots of curry powder.

Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse.  I think the flavor is pretty good with no strange aftertaste.  I purchase my Wyler's lemonade at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.<br /><br />Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you.  A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C.  To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.<br /><br />If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend Acai Lemonade by NOW Foods. It is somewhat pricey but can be found more economically off of Amazon. That product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade is really flavorful, easy to pack and can be very economical.

32615,B002JWZVWO,A2U6GHU2EMC5M5,Rawim,29,30,4,1266019200,They call it nature's sports drink,"I have seen delivery truck for this drink driving around town.  On the side they had ""Natures Sport's Drink"".  I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />The package the drink comes in is ""Tetra Pak""; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding ""natural fruit flavor"" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:<br /><br />Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.  Sadly I am unable to perform blood work and tell you if my electrolytes are being replenished but I am enjoying the flavor.  So if coconut and guava appeal to you, and you would like those flavors in a natural sports drink, this may be the drink for you."
32616,B002JWZVWO,AORGKBNQZ83O8,"MacGuffin ""MacGuffin""",8,8,5,1276128000,"""...with a 'SPLASH' of Pink Guava""","I'm somewhat perplexed as to why reviewers slammed this for not having enough flavor because the name says it all. This is supposed be a light, subtly flavored beverage. I think it's delicious.<br />I'm also left scratching my head as to assertions that this product contains sugar; it contains CANE JUICE which is not only far more dilute than sugar but is enjoyed on its own as a delicious, healthful beverage and is well worth sampling if you can find it (it's fairly easy to find fresh in NYC's Chinatown). For the record, it's not sickeningly sweet and is claimed to have anti-cariogenic properties (I love the stuff). Don't downgrade a product because you don't know how to interpret what's printed on a label (let the negs begin).<br />O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava is very refreshing when you're in need of an electrolyte boost and I agree with other reviewers that 8.5 ounces is insufficient for a fierce thirst; I hope O.N.E. has this flavor slated for 1-liter packaging. The flavor is exquisite, as is the color. This also makes a great base for a pink guava smoothie--blend with a frozen banana, coconut milk (canned is fine), frozen pink guava pulp, and a sweetener of your choice (coconut sugar would be great). Delicious AND pretty! You could also, if you prefer a different liquid (such as yogurt or fruit juice), freeze it in an ice cube tray and add to the other ingredients to thicken and chill your smoothie--it's the kind of product you can get creative with if you're into playing in the kitchen.<br />To sum it up, O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pink Guava does NOT contain added sugar, doesn't claim to be a juice, and is well worth trying, especially if you can find it on sale. In addition, although I'm a Vine Voice, this product wasn't offered to me for review; I'm of my own initiative evaluating my own purchase. Enjoy!"

Maybe it was because the 8.5 oz. size seems like less than I want after I really work out. Maybe it was because the coconut guava flavor (both are flavors which I actually love) seemed super watered down...they should have added more guava! The upshot? I just felt this product fell a bit short on all counts. If I get it for free on bike to work day, I won't turn up my nose, but I wouldn't buy it when there are other options."

However, my last shipment came in a newly designed box and the formula of the coconut/guava mixture had changed.  There is more guava juice now, which I find overwhelming.  The sugar content has also increased.  I've had to purchase plain coconut water to mix with my last order to tone down the guava flavor.  I am not a fan of the change and plan to cancel my monthly subscription.  Beware if you were a fan of the old true splash of guava formula."

It seems the taste either works for some or it doesn't. Some say it is an acquired taste. I do like the taste of guava, so I thought this would be a good way to sample some coconut water. I let it chill fully. Okay, actually I put it in the freezer and forgot about it. Thank goodness the aseptic pack did not burst. Once it was liquid again I gave it a taste and I was very pleased. The ""splash"" of guava was not overwhelming to me, as pure nectar can tend to be. It complemented (masked?) the flavor of the coconut water and was quite refreshing. Pure coconut water is not sweetened, as this one is, so that is a consideration for some. I think I am ready to try some of the pure coconut water now. There are other flavors of this type, too.

I had my wife try it as well, and she had the same feeling.  I looked at the product info, and it states that it has 5% of the USRDA for sodium, which is too much for a drink, in my opinion, especially a ""Coconut Water"".  Something like Gatorade, which is for electrolyte replenishment, I can forgive, but not for this.<br /><br />I then thought more about the taste, besides the saltiness, and what I really had to conclude was that the the mix of flavors didn't do anything for me.  No real sweetness from the coconut, no sourness from the guava.<br /><br />Overall, Not crazy about it.<br /><br />Now, I do have something positive to say about the container, it held up well, and it's relatively easy to open, although I'd add a ring to the aluminum foil-like pull tab.

Despite boasting ""real fruit juice"" on the packaging, the flavor is simply too watered down to notice. Having drank plenty of coconut water, this drink has barely more than a hint of it. Most likely, it clashes with the taste of the guava, which is also hardly noticeable. In fact, were it not for the label on the packaging, this reviewer would not have been able to tell what the flavor was meant to be. Speaking of the which, the odd packaging is rather reminiscent of the fruit juice packs aimed at kids, sans the accompanying straw. Also, this 8.5 ounce drink will not go far to quench anyone's thirst or give any noticeable energy boost. Given the price for a pack of 12, it is not asking for much to give the consumer more juice for the buck. The nutritional content stacks up nicely to other comparable drinks, however it does have more sugar than some others currently on the market. Overall, O.N.E. has produced a product that is nothing special in the world of sports drinks. While it does offer fairly solid nutritional content, the bland taste and small size does not make this a good value."

I didn't really taste the coconut flavor or Pink Guava for that matter.  It has a light, not to sweet, flavor with electrolytes you need to replace if you've been sick or after exercise. The price is not to expensive and I like the single serve containers as most electrolyte solutions have a short shelf life after opening.  Coconut water is good and good for you."
32643,B002JWZVWO,A3JPFWKS83R49V,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""",1,2,2,1265241600,"Good Nutritional Value, but Essentially Flawed","Everyone should drink more water, or so we are told. The problem is that water is plain and boring. It needs some flavor, and many companies have responded to this demand. O.N.E. Coconut water with splash of pink guava is one such product. It contains coconut water along with guava juice for a unique taste.<br /><br />I like the taste of coconut but I am only so- so on the flavor of guava. Still, I decided this drink was worth a try because as long as it emphasized the coconut, it would be fine. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. O.N.E Coconut Water with a splash of guava is misleading in its naming, because you taste more guava than anything. Even then, the taste is rather unexciting. Even lovers of the flavor of guava will likely find this product a letdown.<br /><br />Nutritionally, O.N.E. Coconut water is very good, with low calories and a large dose of vitamin C and electrolytes in each serving, and more potassium than a banana. The sugar content is a little higher than some would prefer, but it isn't too bad and, unlike other sweet drinks, you get a good deal of nutritional trade- off for the sugar. Each time I take a sip and feel dissatisfied, I keep reminding myself of the nutritional benefits.<br /><br />Along with the bland flavor profile, there is one other problem I have with this drink, and that is the packaging. It is sold in a small foil box, which is ordinarily not a problem, but there is no included straw. There is an opening at the top that must be pushed- in to open, but the manufacturer doesn't include a straw. Thus, you have to use a fork or some other device to forge an opening. Then, you must carve out just the right shape for drinking from the box OR have another glass handy in which to pour the liquid.<br /><br />I wanted to like this beverage but when all factors are considered, I must rate O.N.E. Coconut Water with a splash of guava as a below average product. The coconut flavor is masked by the guava, the taste is unexciting, and the packaging is flawed. Yes, you get a good deal of nutrition so the product isn't a complete bomb, but there are other, better tasting products on the market with equally good nutrition, better taste, and more sensible packaging."

Blankenship,5,5,5,1329004800,THIS STUFF WORKS FOR US AND OUR DOGS LOVE IT - PERHAPS IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AND YOURS.,"Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a brand and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same brand will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don't care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:<br /><br />If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!<br /><br />We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious ""things"" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and ""things"" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don't get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain't a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog's needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"

I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).<br /><br />Consistency<br />Coombs is thicker than NP which allows me to pour a thin and controlled stream onto my waffles. I don't like to drown my waffles. I do tend to lose a small amount of syrup onto the edge of the container but I think that must happen with all syrups.<br /><br />Flavor<br />I think the flavor is a little stronger than Nature's Promise. Maybe more than a little stronger.  I'll admit at first I liked Nature's Promise better but I just had to get used to the stronger flavor of Coombs.  Now that I have I can't go back.  And I even tried just out of curiosity.  NP is tasteless when compared to Coombs.  Coombs is a perfect compliment to my whole grain waffles.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and sweetness which allows me to also taste the waffles.<br /><br />Bottle<br />I like the bottle.  The extra unopened bottle sits on a small wooden kitchen cart with some other things and it looks good. Seems to fit in.  Of course you have to refrigerate the opened bottle.  It's easy to use. It has a small handle that I think can fit most people's index finger comfortably. Then you grab the skinny neck with your thumb and middle finger.  It really seems to be very ergonomic.  Very easy to pour.<br /><br />Value<br />When subscribing it's like getting a free bottle of Nature's Promise for every two 32 oz bottles I get.  And because I can easily control the pour I can make one bottle last about two months and that is using it almost every day.<br /><br />Great product.  I highly recommend.

This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber. In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup. What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting. I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor. I would rate the Whole Foods Grade A Amber as a 4 star minus, and the Grade B as 4-5 stars. Having grown up in sugar maple country and bought syrup from the farmers in unmarked gallon cans ('store syrup' never entered our house), I have plenty of experience with maple syrup. [Tip: maple trees and maple syrup are 'organic' by definition. Farmers who tap trees add nothing. Don't pay more for 'organic'.] At our house we 'sugared off' every Winter. For those who know what I'm talking about, read on. For those who don't have any idea, you may be happy with this product.<br />The positive: This syrup is priced right (purchased at $17.31). It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing. It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars."

So if you like that, this is the syrup for you.<br /><br />Once this is all used up (I plan on baking with it as well), I plan on re-ordering the same brand,<br />only the Grade A.  Maybe that will ease them into true maple syrup a little easier!<br /><br />All in all, a great price and good syrup.  My family just isn't quite ready for the strong maple kick!  Three (and a half) stars.  Minus one star for super strong maple flavor and 1/2 star for too thin of consistency (for my tastes).  Best part is, the ingredient label!

The first I bought at the grocery store; it was a grade A.  It lacked much maple flavor.  So I bought this grade B syrup, thinking the stronger flavor would be better liked.  We hate it.  It has a very bitter after taste.  I don't know what to do now becuase we don't like the grade B, but the grade A isn't strong enough in flavor."

It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the ""store-bought"" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?""<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking."

[Tip:  maple trees and maple syrup are 'organic' by definition.  Farmers who tap trees add nothing.  Don't pay more for 'organic'.]  At our house we 'sugared off' every Winter.  For those who know what I'm talking about, read on.  For those who don't have any idea, you may be happy with this product.<br /><br />The Good:  This syrup is priced right (purchased at $17.31).  It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing.  It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars.<br /><br />The Not So Good:  Grade B syrup is normally 'mapley' with caramel notes.  This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber.  In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup.  What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting.  I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor.  I would rate the Whole Foods Grade A Amber as a 4 star minus, and the Grade B as 4-5 stars."

She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major brands of ""pancake syrup maple flavored,"" would stop using high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.<br /><br />Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store brands.<br /><br />I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, ""That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted.""  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.<br /><br />A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life."

I'm no conniseuer of maple syrup like some people on Amazon are, but I can say this has a great maple flavor, the consistency is a little thinner than store bought, imitation maple syrup, but that stuff has artificial thickeners in it.  Remember, this is tree sap, boiled down to reduce the water and increase the sugar content.  Nothing more nothing less.  This syrup makes you want to lick the plate when you're done with the pancakes.  One note, they need to do something to better protect the black plastic cap on the top of the jug because mine was broken when it came.  The jug is sealed well, so nothing spilled.

I've purchased several gallons of maple syrup over the years. This brand was right up there with brands that are much higher in price.<br /><br />I also use this syrup for regular applications like pancakes and french toast. I enjoy the strong flavor and the fact that it's not watery like grade A syrup can be. It's a must for cooking. I make a maple-walnut praline ice cream with it that is simply luscious. I've also used it to make maple breads, cakes and candies.<br /><br />A caveat: Please be sure to refrigerate the syrup after opening it. Mold can form in maple syrup if left at room temperature too long after opening (weeks, not hours).

Well, I can't afford that ..... Yet here I am buying ANOTHER jug. It really is that good. Last week in an attempt to save money I purchased a 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup. It was $36.25 for a 64 oz. jug, which is vastly cheaper than Coombs Family Farms Organic Maple Syrup which is about $23.00 per 32 oz. jug; so you're looking at $46.00 per 64 oz. jug of Coombs compared to the $36.00 per 64 oz. jug of Hidden Springs Vermont. Unfortunately for us thrifty shoppers, the Hidden Springs Vermont is not in the same league as Coombs Organic, and even if I saved $25.00 per jug, I'd probably still go with Coombs -- that is an indication of just how much I love this syrup.<br /><br />Quite simply, I've never had syrup as delicious as Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B.

It's thick, rich and complex. I like it with yogurt, pancakes, fruit, lemonade, in cooking, and even by the shot. However, after reading about maple country and maple syrup culture, I toyed with the romantic idea of buying directly from maple syrup makers. I recently was able to do that. I ordered a gallon of maple syrup grade B from Bear Mountain Vermont Maple (that's the place I chose after some research). Their sugar bush is in a remote mountain that borders Quebec and has never been farmed. Although the syrup is not certified organic, no pesticides or insecticides are used anywhere in the area. These are really nice, honest people and it was a great experience ordering from them. The syrup is great. And the price is good too: 1 gallon is $60 (including shipping) and is shipped in two half-gallon BPA-free containers that have an oxygen barrier coating on the outside to help the syrup stay fresh longer. The service was fast too. I got the shipment just 4 days after I placed my order (I live in Northern California). So yes, I'm really satisfied. I am not ready to say that I prefer this syrup to Coombs Family Farms'. They're both really good in my opinion.

Sometimes the price is very prohibitive, and we still don't know if it's worth the cost.  After looking at the reviews on this product, I went for it.  I'm very glad I did.  Making my own cheap version of maple syrup might do in a pinch, but it will never replace the great taste of this syrup and I will definitely buy it again.  I like the fact that if you must have sweets, something a bit more pure is well worth it.  Especially when it comes to children.  My little toddler grandson was very ill, including an emergency ambulance ride to the local hospital.  We had great difficulty feeding him anything.  I used a loaf of soaked grain bread to make an egg/milk mixture of baked french toast casserole.  Of course I topped it off with this great syrup.  Everyone was amazed that I helped him get his appetite back, but really, after the third plate, I think it was the syrup that did it.  Just a light drizzle swirled over the top made it perfect.

This may be a good syrup to use if you want to put in less syrup in your Master Cleanse lemonades in order to cut calories.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU"">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.

Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980"">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.

This has the most mechanical chewing action for an edible product I've seen.  Greenies are nice but they dissappear really quick and can get pricey.

They work great to keep your dogs teeth in good shape if you can't brush their teeth. Make sure to only use them once daily and the chlorhexidine coating them will work to keep their teeth as pearly white as possible!

And then we discovered the CET chews.  Not only would the CET chews win over me, my dogs would not hesitate to sell me in exchange for them.<br /><br />Every dog in our extended family is addicted.  I think they lace them with something.  Put them up against a regular rawhide and there is no contest.  We all gave each other chews as gifts for Christmas.  (Which in retrospect was dumb, we could have just kept them and saved on shipping...but who knew?)<br /><br />They do work for teeth cleaning by the way.  I have one dog, a rescue, who has some damaged teeth (one broken, others degraded).  He came to me that way.  I've had them cleaned by the vet more than once but since we've discovered a heart murmur sedating him for a cleaning is no longer an option.  The CET chews have helped.  His teeth are still not great, but there is a noticable improvement in the amount of gunk.  My other dog has nice mostly white teeth and the chews have really helped keep them that way.<br /><br />These were also wholeheartedly approved by my vet.<br /><br />And one last benefit...if you want your dog out from under foot for a few minutes these are also handy for that.  I do use them occasionally when I need some quiet or am feeling like there are just too many german shepherds in the house crowding me.

A true golden (2yrs old), she is not picky and will eat most of what we give her, but with these, she will act foolish until she has one in her posession.<br /><br />Choking on the chews:<br />Every time she chews one of these treats, she tries to swallow a large, unchewed portion of the rawhide strip that never fails to get lodged in the back of her throat.  I keep thinking she'll learn to chew the entire treat, she is a smart dog in all other respects and only chokes on this particular treat.

But in our family, that's not a problem.  All bags of chews, no matter the brand, seem to have this issue...thick and thin together...but we just use it to our advantage.  We have 2 dogs: the one we raised from a pup likes a big, thick chew, the other is older and a rescue, and though we take him to the dentist regularly, his teeth are just very sensitive so the smaller chews work out great for him.  The ones in the middle they share equally.<br /><br />Another thing, each chew is coated differently.  The smaller more wrinkled up chews have more of it than the thicker chews which have a smoother surface.  But our boys don't seem to notice these small differences and we're happy as long as they're happy.  In fact, one of the best parts of our evening is watching them settle down beside each other, each with their respective CET chew, engaged in knawing away the time.<br /><br />Is CET messing with the consumer by not correctly sizing their chews 100%?

Rawhide in any form is very dangerous and you must monitor your dog very closely when they are chewing on these. My Great Dane is not a ""swallow whole"" kind of eater - he tries to chew up even the tiniest training treats before swallowing them, BUT with rawhide strips like these he will chew on the whole piece until it eventually becomes soft, then swallow it. Whole. Then choke it back up, chew some more and swallow it whole again. Repeat until it goes down and stays down. This is not healthy and not very safe and I always have to be poised to remove the offending chunk of soft wet rawhide from his throat as he gags it up. He does love these chews but I have not seen any wonderful changes in his teeth so far with 2 weeks of daily use so it will not be worth the trouble or risk of choking for me to buy more once this bag is gone.

They do a fine job of keeping her teeth clean, occupying her while we eat dinner, and best of all they don't seem to have any ill effects on her digestive tract (which is always a concern of mine with rawhide products). They seem well-made and thoughtfully produced. My sole gripe is, as others have mentioned, the uniformity of their size. Our puppy is only 50lbs, but I've found myself having to order the XL size package to ensure the bulk of the package is reasonably sized chews. I originally ordered the normal size package, but the ratio of S:M:L chews was definitely skewed in favor of S:M. Even with the XL size package, where the ratio is skewed M:L, we still get a number of very small chews - chews so small our dog can swallow them nearly whole after just a few minutes of chewing. This creates a serious choking hazard, and I sometimes find myself just throwing these tiny ones away. Obviously the size issue hasn't stopped me from buying the product (I'm very happy with it), but to earn a 5-star review some better size control would be required."

We went back to the chicken and rice diet till things firmed up. A week later we decided to give her another one.

But 15 min (if not less) after eating the chew, my dog had a diarrhea. Amazing! Never seen anything work so fast in that direction. So I had to take him out for a walk every 30 min that night. It was that bad! I thought I will send the product back, but started to read reviews. Found one saying that you should give this chew after the meal. Next time I gave my dog Kong stuffed with his regular food, and then half of the chew, and then more food in Kong. 15 min went ok, and he did not have to run outside. Later same day I did it again - food-chew-food, and he was fine. And I have to mention that he is a big boy and never had problems with his stomach before. And he eats different things.<br />Two things I can summarize - watch your dog during and after you give the chew, and give some food either before or right after the chew is gone."

Now is the time people should know how I feel about these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Bones.<br />Our Vet, who sells those C.E.T. Bones, I tried one pack, but relized after seeing how good they are, I checked Amazon, and sure enough, they sold them, and at a better price.<br /><br />Our Vet said when dogs reach 4 to 5 years old, regular rawhide does grind/chip their back teeth. That worrid me, but Vet said they're not bad, and introducted me to C.E.T. bones.  Dogs have been on them for long time now, and I continue, oftened, to buy C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral... chews.<br /><br />And when so much time passed, and recently Vet both dogs teeth, the older dog, her teeth are the same, they arn't worse.  That to me is GREAT.  Now I order from whoever has the better prices for C.E.T. chews.  (NOTE:-I would check, though, make sure if you want to try these, make sure if you order $25.00 or over, that there's NO POSTAGE, some are 3rd parties, some 3rd parties offer free postage.  Just letting all the Dog lovers know this.)<br /><br />We've been using these Chews for so long, and when it's time to give each of them one, all I say is ""how about a 'Chewy Bone'....WOW, no matter where they are in the house, they come a running, right to the closet in kitchen where I store them.  They also, when I open the pantry, they run to other room, next to kitchen, and sit and wait, while their tails wag alot.  That, at least to me, tells me they really like them.<br /><br />So for anyone out there who wants to know what I think.....I think these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral ARE THE BEST, and I would NOT recommend any other chewy bones, especially rawhide, or any other hard bone.<br /><br />If this previous isn't enough to convince you, I don't know what else to say, other than ""Maybe you should at least try 1 bag, even if you pay postage.  I bet after that 1 bag, depending on size, which I buy the 30 extra large, which is much better price, they have small, medium, the right sizes for any dogs.<br /><br />That's about it.

I personally show very little response to ""placebo effect"" situations and I am a true skeptic at heart. I originally found the ""kid"" version of this product for my daughter while searching for something to boost her immune system. I spent hours on the computer researching the ingredients of these products. I decided to try the adult version for myself and I can honestly say that the Amazing Grass Superfood Powders have made a huge improvement in both of our lives.<br /><br /> My daughter attends daycare and with that setting comes frequent colds/flus, some serious. She spent the better part of each month with varying degrees of sickness. Since we have using the Superfood Powders (months), neither she nor I have gotten sick. We spent time with my parents who were both very ill while she and I remained in good health. Her time spent at daycare has not been reduced but she is now very rarely sick. I can only recall one time since we started using this product and her sneezing/runny nose only lasted for one day. Since no other variable in our lives has been changed, I can only attribute this to the use of Amazing Grass.<br /><br /> It is difficult to make sure that a child is getting all of the necessary nutrients they need in their diet. Amazing Grass takes care of that. I feel better knowing that when my daughter goes through her ""picky eating"" stages, she is still getting the vitamins and nutrients her body needs to stay healthy. I mix 1 scoop of her powder with approx 8oz of milk and 1 tsp Ovaltine...I have never had any trouble getting her to drink it. She asks for her ""choco milk"" at least twice per day!<br /><br />Overall, EXCELLENT product! I am getting ready to purchase my 4th jar!"

When I made a cup of this with milk it seemed like it needed more chocolate flavor so I added ovaltine and it was delicious. So I hid it in a sippy cup so she wouldn't see the tiny green particles floating on top and I didn't tell her anything was different about it but as soon as she started drinking it she started gagging and cried ""I don't like this seedy chocolate milk!""<br /><br />Not wanting to waste it my husband and I have been drinking it.

That being said, I think it's a GREAT product (assuming that it does contain the nutrients it claims to).  I have a 6 year old son and a 3 year old daughter.  They aren't fans of drinking this stuff in milk straight up (I've tried to drink it and can't do it) so I use that milk with their cereal.  They call it their 'vegetable milk' and have become accustomed to it in their cereal.  It does start to separate after a few minutes so the milk has a grainy, green texture to it.  But, again, they get used to it and, for kids who aren't begging to eat their veggies every day, this is a great way to get more nutrients in to their growing bodies."

This is ""Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Imported from Spain and is stated to be ""All Natural & Cold Pressed"". Bear in mind that ""All Natural"" is not ""Certified Organic"".<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $3. for 8 ounces. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat less by volume. Bear in mind, that Olive will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Smaller containers like this 8 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the liter or gallon size containers, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is critical.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

This has a very fresh tasting tomato flavor and re-hydrates easily. I use it to make instant tomato soup, for sauces and in salsa as well as adding to soups, stews, and every where else that one might want some tomato  flavor.  Very easy to adjust texture  can be tomato paste or juice  and is fun to experiment with I even made little tomato balls as a kind of oddball appetizer and everyone who tried them was blown away. Very light weight dry does pack down a bit but has stayed dry in the jug with no problems. This is a  great staple for both daily use and food storage.

Add a little at a time until you get to know how it works.<br /><br />But my favorite way to use it has been on home made pizza in place of tomato sauce.  A light sprinkling before baking yields a delicious tomato flavor without the soggy crust that sauce can often create.  Just sprinkle it on the pizza dough, add oregano and any other herbs and spices,your favorite toppings and bake as usual."

This has a tangy herbaceous flavor<br />and you will taste the blend of garlic, parsley, onion, olive oil, apple cider<br />vinegar, oregano and white pepper. Want more flavor, add your own herbs or<br />garlic but I think this blend is perfect right out of the jar.<br /><br />It can also be used as a spread with bread or to add a boost to vegetables,<br />salads and soups.

Consider the known health benefits of hibiscus tea, the fact that this is organic (which greatly improves the nutritional value), and the unbelievably low price of like $12 for a pound (a pound of this will probably last me 4 months), and you have yourself a winner.

I'm not sure how strong hibiscus tea is ""supposed"" to be, but about 10 petals in a coffee mug works for me. The tea produced is very strong and exceptionally sour which, personally, I love. I would say it's similar in taste to rhubarb which I also love. You can add a sugar or sugar alternative if you want, but I say it tastes great straight.<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a finely chopped powder, but as others have said, these are full petals (see my user added image). You don't really need to buy a tea strainer for this. I use a bombilla sometimes,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141O2IA"">Stainless Steel Spring Bombilla 1 Count</a>, but really, it isn't necessary. Which is convenient for those of us who get lazy. Put petals in coffee mug, pour in water, microwave for 1:30, voila! Just throw away or eat petals when finished. (They have a nice texture to them after they've steeped for a few minutes).<br /><br />Other notes: the tea produced is a very deep and pretty magenta. If it spills on something white, like for example my shirt, it turns into an indigo stain. Would probably be good for and all-natural tie-dye.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br />""A study published in the Journal of Human Hypertension has shown that drinking hibiscus tea can reduce high blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. The study results showed the average systolic blood pressure for those drinking hibiscus tea decreased from 134.8 mmHg (17.97 kPa) at the beginning of the study to 112.7 mmHg (15.03 kPa) at the end of the study, one month later.[5] This is consistent with its supposed role as a diuretic."""

I decided to first call Davidson and see how they would like to resolve the problem.  I received an e-mail response back from Davidson Teas and was told that they have a number of quality control measures in place (sifting and steam sterilization) to prevent problems of this nature.  The response from Davidson Teas unfortunately was ""If unsatisfied with product received, please file a claim with Amazon for exchange/refund"".  If purchasing product directly from them they stated ""we will exchange/refund without any questions asked per our PRODUCT GUARANTEE (on our website)"".  Overall I feel it is a good product at a good price from Amazon but Davidson Teas quality control slipped and when given the chance to resolve the problem failed to adequately address the situation.

Of course there are many kinds of hibiscus with different flavors. The good ones usually great deep red clear drink with some acidity and a nice mild distinguished aroma. This hibiscus looks great from the moment you open the package. It is clean small flattened flower individual leafs.  The first thing I noticed is the absence of the hibiscus aroma. It smells like an old black tea that has been opened for long time.<br /><br />  Now for the drink, once added to boiling water, the drink looks good. It has a nice deep red color and the drink is clear.... Now for the taste: There was no taste what so ever. Juts a little acetic taste and that's it.<br /><br />  The drink has the expected effect of making your body getting rid of excess water but I couldn't enjoy it as a drink at all. I had to add more of the hibiscus with a lot of sugar to create a drinkable drink.... Well, that's not what I expect from hibiscus drink. I would give it only one star just because of the flavor. I am going to increase it to two stars because I used it as a tea additive to give a nice acetic flavor and the anti-oxidants.<br /><br />  My explanation of the lack of flavor is that they picked the younger hibiscus flowers that have the deep color and acidity but didn't develop the real hibiscus taste yet.  Or maybe they dried it fast in machines that caused it to loose flavor. But looking at the leaves and how thin they are makes me think that is the first one.<br /><br />  I tried other Hibiscus products from Amazon and there were some really good ones."

Not the quality, that seems to be just fine, and it's nice to have a pound of organic hibiscus delivered right to your door. The disagreement is about whether it's better to buy a pound of organic hibiscus from amazon (his preference) or whether it's better to pay 60% less per pound by buying hibiscus (jamaica) at the local hispaic-centric market, where it comes in bulk bins and you can even buy just a single scoop of it for a dollar if you're short on cash (my preference.)<br /><br />In theory, I agree that organic is better, but the price difference is quite a lot and I have searched online and haven't found anything (yet) that tells me non-organic hibiscus is saturated with pesticides and will kill me. For all I know, maybe it's more like the coffee beans we buy that don't have an organic certification but they are purchased from small farmers in third world countries that couldn't afford pesticides if they wanted to. I just don't know.<br /><br />Either way, hibiscus is delicious. And this particular hibiscus was very satisfactory when we used it. This is the recipe my boyfriend has devised for making a wonderful iced tea with it:<br /><br />Hibiscus Tea with Cinnamon<br /><br />1 cup dried hibiscus<br />3 sticks of cinnamon (also available by the pound on amazon, and in this case I'd have to say the amazon cinnamon is definitely superior to the hispanic market cinnamon)<br />3 T of raw honey or to taste<br />48 ounces water (six cups)<br /><br />Bring water to a boil in a saucepan on the stove. Add hibiscus and cinnamon and simmer 25 minutes (I've forgotten about it until it was more like 50 minutes and it was still good, but too long can make it bitter.)<br />Remove from heat and strain out the hibiscus and cinnamon. Allow to cool to lukewarm, then add honey. (We use raw honey from the local farmer's market. If your honey is probably not raw, it doesn't make any difference whether you wait to add it or not.)<br />Refrigerate and serve chilled over ice.<br /><br />Hibiscus: is high in vitamin c, is said to be good for improving acne, reduces cholesterol, lowers blood pressure and just like other plants is full of anti-oxidants.<br />Cinnamon: can lower blood pressure, regulate blood sugar, and has even been reported to relieve arthritis.<br />Honey: is delicious. :) And if you buy local honey from your local farmer's market, it may even help you with hayfever type allergies. Hey, it's worth a try!"

I have let it set as long as over night. Remember that this is not black tea - it will not get bitter if you steep it too long.

Then I added a teaspoon of honey and a dash of cinnamon. The result was one of the most delicious tasting teas I ever drank. It was smooth and even better than the tea bags. The way I used it I would estimate that I have enough to make at least 50-100 cups. I also like the fact that the tea comes in a zip lock type of bag.

Perhaps this tea has lost some of its flavor since the bag didn't seem very air tight.<br /><br />Other reviews also mention a floral smell when brewing the tea, to me it smelled a little like compost, which was slightly off-putting.  The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either- it did smell barely of dried flowers.<br /><br />The color is nice- a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok- but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.<br /><br />I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity/sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.<br /><br />The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.

I left the bag at work and came back only to find half of it gone!  All of my friends like it too.  Highly recommended."

33188,B000SATIZA,A997PUM414JUE,goatroper,1,1,5,1330473600,"Brew With Stevia, Drink instead of Soda","I use the hibiscus flower tea thus:<br /><br />In a slightly larger than two quart (half gallon) container place 3/4 to 1 cup hibiscus flowers and 3/4-1 tablespoon dried stevia leaves.<br /><br />Add two quarts of boiling water.<br /><br />Let sit for at least 10 minutes.  Drink some hot (if you like).  When it is cool, strain through a fine sieve or mesh into a refrigerator container and enjoy cold.<br /><br />My daughters (12 & 14) enjoy drinking this cold over ice instead of soda and take it to school in the morning in their water bottles.  I drink it cold after running, working in the yard, or going to the gym as it is extraordinarily refreshing cold.  It also tends to keep me from snacking between meals.  We go through about 2-3 gallons/week, mostly cold.<br /><br />Other recommendations:  It stains, so pour it over the sink or something that won't stain.  It is very convenient online, but can also be purchased from many local Mexican markets from the same section as dried peppers.  Consider keeping in a sealed container (I use Lock & Lock) for freshness and to keep from getting wet (again because it will stain). Stevia leaves are not the same as Stevia powder (the powder is much stronger).<br /><br />update:<br />I've used the ""Frontier Bulk Stevia Herb Powder(Green), CERTIFIED ORGANIC, 1 lb. package"" from Amazon instead of the dried stevia leaves from my garden. While brewing 1/2 gallon (2 quarts) of tea, I still used 1 cup of dried hibiscus flowers and 1 level teaspoon of stevia herb powder. Tastes the same as when I use the dried leaves from my garden.  Note:  green stevia powder is not the same as stevia extract."
33189,B000SATIZA,AFJE6HQNUFJ1H,Lisa Curll,1,1,5,1326758400,"Ah, Hibiscus Tea...","I was concerned about purchasing this bag as opposed to the bag of cut and sifted flowers for a few dollars more, because the review on that product suggested this bag may contain stems, bulbs, and other less desirable parts.  I have found this to be untrue - the bag I received (which did have a ziploc-style top) contained only pure petals.  I put mine into a metal tea holder and steeped it in hot water, and the tea came out vibrant and delicious.  I intend to make lots of this and then chill it, as I prefer it cold.  A little sugar can make this drink a little sweeter, which I find I prefer when the tea is hot.  Also... it's really pretty.  I'm excited to serve this non-traditional beverage to my houseguests.  The bag is huge, too, and given that I'm usually the only one in the house that will drink it (my husband is a coffee fiend), I might freeze half of it until I need it.<br /><br />I've found this bag is really simple and much preferable to more processed teas."

The zip-lock bag would do well if I were were drinking from only one. I vacuum packed 3/4 of each and stored them in the freezer. The partial bags are in the fridge ready to use.

By itself, I found it a little too fruity, tangy flavored, but that is just my personal preference.  I really wanted to like it enough to want to drink it all the time, at least 3 cups a day.  Being a tea drinker anyway, and having lots of tea at my disposal I started blending it with other teas.  For evening I use a heaping t. each of red rooibos and  African honeybush (both Davidson's) and 5 or 6 pieces of this tea and steep for maybe 10 min.  Add a dollop of raw honey--delicious.  I will sometimes steep this a second time.  I enjoy it every evening before bed.  For daytime I just make my regular gunpowder green (again, Davidson's) or my oolong, or whatever I feel like that day.  Sometimes I even mix them, and add 6 or so pieces of hibiscus leaves and a dollop of honey.  The hibiscus adds just the right fruity tangy taste and results in a wonderful tasty tea that I enjoy drinking throughout the day.  I am hopeful that using it this way I will be drinking enough of it to reap the health benefits that it provides. The bag is huge and I am sure will last me a long time.  When I finish it off, I will for sure buy some more."

I brewed about 8 leaves in a teapot of boiling water - steeped for about 6 minutes, poured it into a mug and tasted.  I was reluctant at first, but I've had the Celestial Seasonings Zinger teas, so I was somewhat familiar with hibiscus.  Well, this is so much better.  I am so happy with this organic hibiscus tea.  And, you don't even need a tea strainer.  The flowers are whole, so you just steep and pour.  I used a teapot that my aunt had given to me and it worked beautifully. The flowers just stay at the bottom of the pot. I ordered this just 3 days ago from Amazon and it arrived just over an hour ago - perfect condition and ready for me to brew my first - not to be my last - cup of hibiscus tea!  Great product."

The 'tea' itself  consists of large pieces of hibiscus relative to what you expect as tea, and after you break it up, it only takes a couple to fill the tea ball.  This is like buying 3 pounds of regular tea that has already been flaked.  Great flavor too.  I think my co-op buys this, grinds it, and resells it at 3 times the price."

Since drinking 3 to 4 cups a day my diastolic bp has decreased about 10 points and my cystolic bp has dropped about 8 points. To be completely transparent I am also drinking the same amount of Davison's Bulk Rooibos Tea per day.<br /><br />Both teas taste great. The hibiscus smells like fragrant flowers and tastes just a bit sour but that's fine.  The rooibos has a different frangrance and tastes smoother and more delicate compared to the hibiscus.<br /><br />I just ordered more rooibos tea and will order more hibiscus when the bag gets low.

I wrote to the seller about this matter and through Amazon but I did not receive a response from the seller. In my case, I ordered 6 Equal dispensers which amounts to $17.34 but then I was charged $11.94 for shipping [$1.99 for 'each' dispenser] even though they were shipped together in a single package with very negligible package weight. I asked the seller to perhaps consider [no matter who orders the product] a more reasonable [read: equitable] shipping and handling charge based on the actual weight of the package and the fact that the multiple item order is shipped in one single package, but as I said, and to date, I received no response from the seller.<br /><br />So too, various of these dispensers have tablet jamming problems and you've got to often bang on the thing to get the small tablet out in one piece. Further, it's difficult to find these tablet dispensers in supermarkets, the why of which escapes me, but when they first came out, the dispenser had a small lid on the bottom and the tablets came out intact and freely but when the Equal folks moved to the newer tablet 'click' dispensers, the tablet jamming became a problem and this 'may' account for the Equal folks going with the sweetener 'granule' or sweetener 'powder' packets for their sweetener vs the hard tablet dispensers.<br /><br />I think charging $1.99 for 'each' dispenser but which is shipped in a 'single' package borders on shipping and handling fee inequity. In the future, I'll simply order the dispensers one by one and 'then' I can at least justify the seller shipping and handling charge even though I'll wind up paying the same but it would then have to be sent in multiple packages!

I have to use 3 tablets and 1 packet of Equal to get the right sweetness that 2 packets give me.

But boy, someone at Amazon needs to listen to the customers and understand that the customers are educated.<br /><br />Many many of your grocery prices are silly when compared with local market prices in US. This product is a perfect example. It sells at normal MSRP for $9.99/lb in Austin TX in WholeFoods or SunHarvest, yet amazon price is $16.67/lb for a bulk pack? In fact this trend is true in many of the departments. Amazon needs to start showing prices that are real rather than try to ""show"" a big discount.

Well I gotta say this tastes horrible. I have been drinking mate for a long time as I lived in Argentina, and this tastes nothing like normal mate. I understand the idea behind this mate, and the better health reasons behind having it unsmoked and organic, which organic and unsmoked sounds like an amazing idea, especially since I prefer organic everything! The problem is that this mate tastes nothing like normal mate, and really doesn't have a good taste. There are a lot of Americans who when they drink mate out of a gourd and bombilla who think that it tastes like dirt. Well this mate is definitely a dirt earthy taste. It tastes nothing like a good crop of mate, this is highly agreed by my Argentinian friend who ended up throwing his purchase in the garbage just after 2 gourds full, and eventually I tried to struggle through this yerba, but in the end it was just too much for me. Waste of money, and the many Argentinians that are friends of the family want to stay away from this mate, when even they would prefer to drink organic as well. Sorry eco teas, but your crafty wording, and healthy image doesn't always mean it is good. I mean just because you have a pretty label, and you take out all the stalk from your teas does not mean they are truly better. The stalk is fundamentally part of yerba mate, as an image and why waste the other part of the plant right? For an alternative to smoked mate and non organic there are better ones out there...."

Flavored, unflavored, with herbs, with sweeteners, roasted, and organic. This is the first ""Unsmoked"" Mate that I can recall having tried and it has turned out to be the strangest Mate yet. My taste buds really hated me for sticking with this Mate. I can now say that the bag is finished, the damage is done, but man it really is bad tasting Mate. I gave this stuff and fair try and thought maybe it would grow on me, but like hell! This stuff tastes more like dirt and hay than it does Mate! As for why the taste is off, it is difficult to say what is actually going on. It is entirely different from the traditional taste of Mate. The bad taste has nothing to do with it being ""Organic"", that much I know. I've tried several ""Organic"" brands and this is the only one Ive had a problem with. I toyed with the idea that it may be a bad batch, but I know that's not the case as I've bought two bags of this stuff and it's the same taste. The only obvious problem with this Mate is it being unsmoked. So if you are looking to buy that traditional tasting Mate, look elsewhere. And another problem, perhaps, is a simple issue of it not being aged long enough? I don't know. I've heard that two years is the ideal length of time, but really don't know much about the subject of aging Mate. Anyways, I looked on the website for any information on how long it is aged but found nothing.<br /><br />As for recommendations on other Mate, and really I suggest finding another brand, here are some brands worth looking into; Titrayju (highly recommended), Roapipo (a personal favorite), Taragui, Cruz de Malta, Amanda, Nobleza Guacha, and Rosamante.<br /><br />Rosamante, Cruz de Malta, and Taraqui are all found on Amazon I believe.

But I've gone and tried many of the European and other brands available as well.<br /><br />The only brand that stands up to Starbucks for my personal taste test is Carte Noire. This is a little funny, because Carte Noire is a supermarket brand in France. (Kraft markets both Starbucks and Carte Noire in grocery channels, and they developed the Tassimo system.) To my taste, it's full-flavored without being overly bitter.<br /><br />This Carte Noire Kenya is one of my favorites. It's in between the espresso discs and Starbucks coffee discs. It is bolder/darker and more intense than the strong coffees like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2"">Starbucks Verona</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW"">Starbucks Kitamu</a>; but less bitter than straight espresso. The volume produced is in between as well--it underfills a coffee cup, but overflows an espresso cup. Finally, the Kenya is programmed in the Tassimo to add the ""crema,"" the dark foam on top of an espresso, on a short cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you have Tassimo, and if you like the darker Starbucks blends on it, and you want to check out one of the European brands--this is the one to try."

We recently got these and it quickly became one of our absolute favorites. It has a VERY smooth taste, it's got a full flavor that is a touch fruity and is made with 100% Kenyan Arabica beans, rather than a blend like you often see in other brands.<br /><br />Negatives: This is ""European style"" so you should know it's a smaller cup.  If more is important to you, you might want to go with Starbucks since they seem to make the largest cups. This doesn't mean this one is stronger and that one is watered down since the Tassimo reads how much water to add to whatever brand you put in from the barcode on the disc. The Starbucks we found that is closest to this is their Kitamu. I like that the t-disc makes more of that one, however we do like this taste better...it's smoother. So it's really what's important to you. Size or taste...some mornings we need the largest cup!<br /><br />Conclusion: Excellent coffee.

I also have a miniature schnauzer. I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them ""All Stages no grain"" dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased."

DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bar, weighing-in at 34 grams with the ingredients unsweetened chocolate, maltitol (from wheat), cocoa butter, unsweetened cacao nibs, soy lecithin, and natural vanilla is good eats even if you're not a diabetic. (Maltitol is also commercially derived from corn and potatoes, which is good to know in case you want to whip up a batch at home.)<br /><br />An ever bigger endorsement comes from my nutrition-conscious wife who, while wagging her finger at my dietary lapses and counting-up the potential life insurance payout from my expected cheese burger-induced demise, finds nothing overly objectionable in the candy's Nutrition Facts for the 1-bar serving: Calories 170, Fat Cal. 110, Total Fat 12g, Sat. Fat 8g, Trans Fat 0g, Cholest. 0mg, Sodium 25mg, Total Carb 19g, Dietary Fiber 2g, Sugars 0g, Maltitol 15g, Protein 2g, Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 1%, Iron 5%.<br /><br />After munching a bar down, the wife's comment was ""Smooth, with a nice crunch!"" (I must mention at this point that she's the dark chocolate aficionado in this house.)<br /><br />While I think the bar is pretty good also, I'm the cerebral type that finds more of interest in the product packaging. There is the tag line ""Fine Belgian Chocolate"", as well as the reminders that the confection is ""gluten free"", ""carb controlled"" and ""all natural.""<br /><br />Interestingly, while the Total Carbs dose is listed as 19g, the Net Carbs is but 2g and the ""Non-Impact Carbs"" is 17g. I had to ask the in-house expert about that last bit, and she said that was the non-digestible total represented by the 15g Maltitol plus 2g Dietary Fiber. Gee, who would've guessed?<br /><br />But, for me, the MOST INTERESTING component of the label is the very small print advisory that ""Excessive consumption may have a mild laxative effect."" What's that all about?<br /><br />A bit of research reveals that maltitol is one of several polyols, i.e. low digestible carbohydrates, which can cause flatulence and, um, loose stools. It seems that each polyol has a certain laxation threshold, which is the amount of the polyol that can be consumed on a daily basis before the laxative effect is likely to kick in (though the outcome, so to speak, differs among individuals). The threshold is expressed as the LTV, or Laxative Threshold Value. The relevant point here is that the LTV for maltitol is 100g - or just over six DARK CHOCOLATE & COCOA NIBS bars! Is seven excessive? (I wonder if that many cheeseburgers have the same effect. Maybe if they're double-doubles. You think?)<br /><br />Also of note was the fact that Amber Lyn Chocolates, Inc. is located in St. George, UT. I've driven through there twice without taking much notice. I may have to go back; perhaps the company has a factory outlet store. If so, I'm in!"

I give it an extra star because my child seemed to like it.<br /><br />However, I wouldn't want my children eating these often because when I looked at the nutrition label, I saw that indeed, these cookies are highly processed.  Yes, the first ingredient is whole grain oat flour and rolled oats and whole wheat flour are up there.  So I suppose things could be worse.  The four grams of fiber per serving is nice, though it may come from the inulin rather than the whole grains.  What is not nice is the palm oil, multiple sugars (including corn syrup) and multiple preservatives in the ingredient list.<br /><br />The cookies are individually wrapped and the packaging is probably the most attractive part of the product.<br /><br />For myself or my children, a home baked cookie would be much preferable to these.

Well, Quaker Oats got the TEXTURE right...<br /><br />These cookies were a TOTAL disappointment.  There's just NO richness to them at ALL - the flavor is mostly a sort of mechanical reference to the taste of oatmeal in a real homemade cookie.

I wonder if those taste any better, or if there is any taste to those either?<br /><br />The best thing I can say about these cookies, is that they are individually wrapped, and fairly high in fiber, 4 grams per cookie, which is 16%.  The sugar content of each cookie is 9 grams, so not too bad. The carbohydrates are 26 grams, which is kind of high, at least to me, per cookie.<br /><br />Calorie wise they are 180 calories per cookie.  The total fat is 8 grams, of which 2 of those grams are saturated fat, 15 milligrams of cholesterol, which is 5%, 160 mg of sodium, which is 7%.<br /><br />What really bothers me is that there is a LONG list of ingredients.<br /><br />I tried two of these cookies, to see if I felt any different about the taste.

The almonds were whole but small and the chocolate was in small chunks but there weren't enough of either to be a very strong taste.  I even thought it could have used more oatmeal which maybe would have kept it from being so crumbly.<br /><br />I guess I was just expecting more of a sweet taste from something with chocolate and almonds.

They do have a slightly chemical taste, but that's typical for this kind of cookie. I would have liked them to be a bit less dry. I found I had to drink a whole bottle of water while I ate just one of these.<br /><br />While they do have slightly more healthy stuff than, say, a normal packaged chocolate chip cookie, (I did like that they had 4 grams of fiber), I just felt myself wishing they would taste slightly better."

I don't know, but this did not taste like any oatmeal cookie I've ever tasted....no cinnamon or brown sugar flavor, just....well, kind of sawdusty.

The chocolate chunks were not plentiful but I didn't mind that as much as I don't like big hunks of chocolate in my cookies; chocolate lovers might be a bit disappointed.  Due to the dryness of this cookie I wouldn't be likely to purchase these in the store as I really prefer a much moister cookie."

Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.<br /><br />The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.  Which is surprising since there is no butter in the ingredients, I can only guess the flavor was added.<br /><br />Overall a decent cookie, nothing special, but they are soft, and come individually wrapped so you don't have to worry about them drying out.  I think without much effort you could make something just as good at home, but if you are looking for something to throw in the lunchbox that provides some fiber (4g) and some nuts (3g protein) you wouldn't be too far off going with these.<br /><br />If you have a question feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer."

Quaker oatmeal cookies had 3 ½ inch diameter, full ½ inch thick, with a shelf life of 4 months after arrival into my house. Too good to keep shelved that long. Grandkids approved.<br /><br />Comparing nutrition on equal gram basis, the oatmeal was fractionally more on calories & fat, but considerably better on sodium and fiber (things important on my diet.)

Being less than a chocoholic, the bits of chocolate were just enough. Being a giant nut fan, the ample almonds won me over. Almonds are the healthiest nut according to my nutritionist.

If you reduce or eliminate either or both of those, you no longer have a ""cookie,"" but a sad imitation of one, generally not worth eating. Quaker has tried to make a better-for-you cookie not by reducing its evil components, but by adding other virtuous ones, in this case whole grain oats. This yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset, at least partially, its less nutritious aspects.<br /><br />Let's look at the numbers of two very classic cookies. Three Nabisco Oreos weigh 34 grams, have 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber. Three Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip cookies weigh 33 grams, have 160 calories, 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.<br /><br />One of these Quakers weighs 42 grams, has 180 calories, 8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber. So you get about 25% more cookie for about the same calories and fat, and you get 4 times the fiber. If they were as good as the other two, you'd have a hands down winner. Unfortunately, this is where reality intrudes. They aren't.<br /><br />On the other hand, they're not bad at all, perhaps just a step behind the Nabiscos and Keeblers that we all love. If you're like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day, they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what's needed. And you will feel like you've eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter."

However, the ingredient list is rather extensive and includes many different types of sugar in the form of sugar: fructose, invert sugar syrup, sugar, honey, corn syrup and brown sugar molasses.  Quite a variety of sugars there!  Which is interesting, since the cookie itself isn't very sweet.  Actually, the sweetness level is just right, in my opinion.<br /><br />The total carbohydrate count for one cookie is 26 grams.  Total fat = 8 grams.  Sugars = 9 grams.  I'm not so sure that this is the healthiest option for a snack.  Probably a better choice than a candy bar since it has fiber, but not something you'd want to snack on if you're on a diet.<br /><br />Bottom line?

To Quaker's credit, they individually wrap each cookie to maintain its softness.<br /><br />Each cookie is nearly 200 calories for barely more than an ounce of pleasure.  The box's photo leads one to believe there are large chunks of chocolate and almonds lodged in each cookie.  That's just not the case--unless you are viewing them with a magnifying glass.<br /><br />In our house, cookies cannot get stale.  They're gobbled up and gone in no time.

It's great that whole-grain oat flour is used to make these cookies, and it's also great that each cookie comes with 4 grams of dietary fiber which is about 16% of what we each need in an ideal day.  The taste however, is merely OK and that's putting a good spin on it.  I was glad to see that each cookie is individually wrapped and when I unwrapped my first cookie, it certainly seemed moist and inviting.  But when I bit into it, my anticipation turned to disapointment. The fiber must come from sawdust because that was my first thought.  The flavor was mediocre at best, not very strong and not, unfortunately, enough to overcome the fibrous texture.  I wish I could taste some of the almond flavor and a bit more chocolaty goodness instead of the bland nature of the oat flour.<br /><br />So if you're looking for healthy snacks, there are better alternatives out there that offer all of the fiber, etc. but without the 180 calories per cookie.

A couple of the cookies had started to break/fracture right out of the packaging, and this may have been a function of how dry they were.

Each cookie is sealed in it own pouch so when you open it up it is fresh.  They come 6 packs to the box.  If you need fiber in your diet you can get 4 g per cookie.  You also get 180 calories per cookie.  While the label on the box states that the cookies are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats (and they are) they are also made with wheat.  If you read down the ingredients they also contain soy bean oil.  While this is not important to most people it is to any allergic or sensitive to either ingredients.

Each cookie is 180 calories.<br /><br />If you want to have something to pack in a lunch box or stash in a drawer at the office, these will remain fresh for quite a while.  My box has an October 25, 2012 best-used-by date -- about three months at least.<br /><br />Of the six packets in the box, four cookies were whole and two were broken.  The cookie is soft but very dry which was interesting because the chocolate chunks melt on contact with your fingers.  The chocolate was soft, the almond pieces were firm, and the whole oat grains were slightly tough.  My first impression was dry with a sawdust-like texture.<br /><br />Overall, I would suggest having this treat with something liquid - coffee, hot tea, milk.  It actually does look like a fresh home baked cookie so it is attractive to the eye.  The chocolate chunks and almond pieces were large enough to be easily identifiable and the cookie was not overly sweet, just enough to satisfy a craving for something to treat yourself with.  This product will not be a favorite with my family, but I can certainly see where they would be convenient for specific reasons and at specific times."

The cookies themselves were heavy on the oats and quite generous with the chocolate (but not the almonds).  Each cookie was quite substantial and just two of them with milk could be a satisfying meal.<br /><br />The cookies were soft and chewy, but not at all gooey, like eating a jelly bean or peanut butter.  The oat content had good consistency and the total cookie was pleasing to nibble on.<br /><br />Would I buy the product if given the chance?  Probably not, as it is not a good dippin' cookie.

Maybe if you enjoy the taste of sawdust and cardboard.,"As a self-professed cookie connoisseur, I was excited to try out Quaker's new oatmeal cookies. Unfortunately I cannot express my disappointment enough. While they may not be hands-down the worst cookies ever, they are far from even being mediocre and taste nothing like any oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten. They're a very dry and gritty cookie (I'm talking sawdust dry grit here) that taste of preservatives and, oddly enough, sugary blandness. If cardboard was more crumbly, I imagine it'd taste about the same with sugar and preservatives added. The chocolate and almonds may have an alright flavor, but what little is added isn't enough to salvage these cookies and the rest of the cookie overwhelms the taste of those two ingredients with its grit and dryness. After eating one cookie, I had absolutely no desire to have another one. Ever. Purporting to be a ""healthy"" cookie (relatively speaking, they are cookies after all), they do have four grams of fiber and three grams of protein, but at 180 calories with two grams of saturated fat, there are much better alternatives out there. Say, ones that actually taste good. And I haven't even touched upon the mega list of ingredients in these suckers, which is long, way longer than any ""healthy"" cookie should have. While the packaging has the proclamation that these are ""Naturally Flavored"", they also fail to mention there are artificial flavors included as well. You can be assured I'll not be getting these again and will be cautious about other Quaker products, those that venture beyond regular oatmeal that is, from now on. While each of the six cookies is individually wrapped to easily grab-and-go, it's almost as easy to take any cookie and put it in a baggie or container. I don't recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> unless you just cannot pass them up and they're on sale at a super low price, otherwise you won't miss a thing.<br /><br />P.S.

Plus it comes from the good folks at Quaker Oats. And yes, whole grain oat flour is listed first among the ingredients, and yes, each cookie contains 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the RDA). The taste, however (and let's be honest, here--why else does one eat a cookie?), leaves much to be desired. It's superior to run-of-the-mill hard-baked chocolate chip cookies, but that's not really saying much. As soft-baked cookies go, this one is just mediocre. The chocolate flavor is not especially rich, the almond flavor is so subtle that it's almost undetectable, and the cookie's overall texture and flavor are decidedly bland. If I'm going to eat 180 calories worth of cookie, I'm going to opt for a much tastier indulgence than this."

(Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.<br />After several more ""going nowhere"" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.<br /><br />Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.<br /><br />I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.  I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service.<br /><br />By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section."

My only negative would be that its a little runny, but I can live with that."

I, however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty.  The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness.  No chemical aftertaste of Splenda.  I am a foodie, but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months.  After the past three weeks, I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly!  Bare in mind, this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though.  It is thinner, but what would you expect from a no calorie, no carb sauce?  If you are needing variety in your menu, give this a try.  You might just find an unexpected delight!"

When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup ""flavors"" that I have tried this is my favorite.

This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM."

Instead of a circle with a hole in the middle they are squares with little indention's (they kind of look like Halls cough drops) so you get more candy for your buck.

Also, palm sugar has a good amount of nutrients and minerals in it. While I certainly do not consider it a health food I am pleased to know that instead of impacting harm it could be doing a little good!<br /><br />Be careful of what brand you buy.<br />I heard that some american companies are mixing it with cane sugar; other brands have more calories than this organic one from Navitas.<br /><br />The taste?

Feeding cats regular milk can (and usually will) cause loose bowels and real stomach discomfort. This stuff has lactose enzymes in it to help them digest it. Also, it often goes on sale at PetSmart for .99 cents or $1.19. Even at full price it's still relatively inexpensive. The only real negative comment I have is that if you don't use it within a few days of opening it, the spout gets all crusty and the milk at the bottom of the carton gets thick. It may still be fine to feed this to them in that condition, but I am paranoid and often end up throwing out half the carton because I don't use it quickly enough.The ingredients are awesome, actual real low-fat milk plus a digestive enzyme plus added taurine (an essential nutrient for cats).<br /><br />PS- MUCH better than the Whiskas CatMilk.

I chose them because they seemed fairly healthy, and all of the ingredients were something easily recognizable.  After a week of giving him these (following the feeding instructions), he got violently ill.  He went outside to potty and collapsed on the deck on the way back into the house.  He deficated while lying on his side.  I called him to me, he got up and slowly made his way to me before falling over again.  When I picked him up, his head was lolling from side to side and he couldn't keep his eyes open.  I went to grab my shoes and purse while my mom looked up the closest emergency vet.  That's when he began vomiting.<br /><br />By the time we were seen at the vet hospital, his vitals were retuning to normal.  I explained what had happened and they said he'd probably had a seizure.  After checking him out, they said that he seemed fine, but asked what he'd been eating, was it possible that he'd gotten into a pesticide, etc.  At the time, I couldn't think of anything.  When we retuned from our trip, I took him to our regular vet and they did a work up on him.  They didn't find anything.  A couple of weeks later I was watching the news, and when they mentioned that the next story was about dog treats making pets sick, I knew.  I didn't immediately remember the brand name, but after looking up the type and look of the package, I knew it was Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Yam Good.  To confirm, I called my mom and made her pull out the package.  I was right.  These treats we're the ONLY thing different in his diet.<br /><br />I am thankful that he only had an acute attack from these and not something chronic or worse.  I am going to write a letter to the Neslte pet division, to their CEO, CFO, board of directors, anyone, to let them know that they are making pets sick and worse.

I didn't count on my wife and son acquiring a taste for it as well.  Twelve bags is only about a three month supply.  While other flavors are available, I think the cheddar cheese flavor best approximates the flavor of buttered popcorn. I can now watch a movie and enjoy the old custom of munching on ""popcorn"".

It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly.

We kept getting nowhere with our family practice physician so switched to a pediatrician at 6 months old. After I quit nursing her, hoping putting her to formula would stabilize her diet, we went through formula after formula trying to find one that wouldn't make her gassy or throw up. She ended up having multiple food sensitivies, although not allergies. (She was sensitive to soy, dairy, and goat's milk as far as formula options before the age of 1.) Finally, we visited a pediatric g.i. physician a few times. They were the ones that told us to try this formula, saying give it 2 weeks to really see if it is working for  her or not. After 2 days, our daughter was a different girl. So much happier. she had been on  reflux meds all this time too, with no real help from them alone. Getting her on this formula really turned her around. What a relief. Not saying this will work for all babies everywhere, but it was a great finding for our daughter. Yes, it smells bad...to me. Our daughter made no faces ever and never refused it even once, even though the g.i. doctor cautioned us she might because it doesn't taste very good. She had no issues with it though."

The fishy odor in the packing liquid rinsed off quickly and completely.<br /><br />To prepare I drained the packing liquid then filled the package with warm tap water and poured it off three times.  Next I poured the noodls in a strainer and rinsed for about two minutes under running water.  Last, I soaked them for half an hour in warm tap water changing the water twice; then rinsed and drained.  This was over kill as the fishy odor was gone after the first rinse but I had heard so much negative about this I took no chances. Even so, rinsing was quick with each step taking two or three minutes.<br /><br />I cooked these using a dry roasting method.  In a no stick skillet pre heated on high, I cooked the drained noodles for exactly one minute. After cooking I removed the pan from the heat and added half a tablespoon of canola oil an a tablspoon of prepared stir fry sauce along with a sprinkle of dried seasonings.  Mix and serve.<br /><br />That's it.  One package was about a cup of noodles.  They are not pasta so if that's what you are looking for you will be disapointed.

Fowler ""Dragonfly77""",16,16,5,1271116800,"Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, healthy, and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!","Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />*  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />*  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />*  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />*  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />*  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />*  High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!"

Kehoe Jr.,15,15,5,1287100800,Outstanding Food for both healthy and sick cats,"I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote ""In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen."" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don't care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.<br /><br />Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech."

I didn't even gradually introduce it like I should have - one day she was eating Purina One, the next Natural Balance. The one major thing I've noticed after weeks on this food? Her coat is SO much SOFTER/SHINIER! She's so silky and soft now! Holy cow! I know if it's doing such good things for her fur it's a good sign. Her bowel movements have always been nice and solid, and they look even better on this food.

I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs."

I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me.

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around."

While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned.

There was plenty of spice, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is not a fan of hot, spicy food, but if you are buying food from this region, it's probably to be expected (the description calls it mildly spicy). The vegetables dominate the mixture, which was very easy to prepare, even in the microwave. Despite what the box says, you get one nice-sized serving per package. Considering this isn't a dish most would be likely to make on their own, it's a nice cullinary departure and worth a try."

This is kind of oily and the vegetable korma I order out is always creamy. This also has cubes of cheese, which I've never had in my vegetable korma before. However, I think it has a good flavor. If I could describe it in non-Indian terms, it's a bit like a minestrone flavor, but of course it has that curry gravy. I would agree with the other reviews, I noticed maybe three pieces of cashew in this. I thought vegetable korma has raisins in it too, but this doesn't seem to have any. This is actually one of Kitchens of India's lower-calorie offerings -- I wondered how vegetable korma could be low calorie, but now I see it's because it's not creamy the way it is at restaurants. Still, it's decent if you don't expect the same thing you'd order out. Would go well with some basmati rice."

Now THIS variety must be new, because we saw it in May for the first time in a local store (for 3.99 a pack, imagine!!!) and shortly after it also appeared available here.<br /><br />It is mildly spicy, very well for european taste (we don't like things toooo hot!), and I love the little Tofu dices (they call it different). The cashews are few, and yes, they are soft, not crunshy. That comes from the simmering, I guess.<br /><br />We eat a pack a person, actually, over Jasmin (or Basmati) rice or Naan, when we find it locally. (I wished I could make Naan myself).<br /><br />A tip for variety: I am preparing different varieties of KOI for each person, and then the plates are exchanged to share. Usually it is just Hubby and me, so I make 2 different packs and we swap the plates after having eaten an half each.<br /><br />We are living on one small income in a low-income state, so we have to watch the money quite much. So I was enthused when I was able to stock up for half the price in June!!! Well, compared to local supermarket stores it was even better ( = less!) than half, as amazon's prices were already lower.<br /><br />I have stocked up really big, my pantry is now filled up with all KOI products for probably 2 or 3 years.

I'm somewhat new to seaweed but there's definitely a nice variety of colors (red, white, clear, light green, dark green) and textures among the seaweed- it looks beautiful in a salad. Sixty-some dollars is alot for a pound of food but at 1/4 cup (dry) per serving of sea weed salad, this will last you a while: the bag says there's 90 quarter-cup servings in the bag.  The sea weed swells alot when soaked in warm water.  Also, I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't just run out to my local Asian supermarket to see if they have a similar product for half the price.<br /><br />The seaweed smelled nice and fresh, a gentle ocean smell- no stinky fish smell, no ""off"" flavor.  There's no sauce or seasoning on it, you make your own.  Unlike the limp salads made of wakame leaves, this seaweed mix makes a light and ""fluffy"", ""perky"" salad.  This product definitely makes a fancier, better seaweed salad than I've had at the 6 or 7 Japanese restaurants I can remember eating at.  Although, if you are looking for just dried wakame stems, this is not that product.<br /><br />I googled and found a dressing I really like, made of 3T rice vinegar, 3T soy sauce, 2T sesame seed oil, 1tsp sugar, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2 chopped scallions, all just mixed together.  (The dressing even stays good in a cup in the fridge for a week or two!)  I soak the seaweed for 10 or 15 minutes in warm water, drain, mix in the dressing, and it's ready.  To make a small amount of seaweed stretch further, I serve it on top of shredded carrot and/or shredded radish.  (I got that idea from my local Japanese restaurant.)<br /><br />Unlike Emerald Cove's 3lb wakame product, which is made in China, this 1lb sea salad is a product of Japan. The website says that it is wild-harvested along Japan's coast.  It's imported by Great Eastern Sun from Ashville NC. The label lists no preservatives or anything besides seaweed as ingredients."

The fish eggs by itself were pretty good and I found the rice good but with a weird texture.  However its fun and I'm glad I bought it.

It was as fun to make as I expected, and you really do get to make ""popping-boba-like eggs"" to put on top of one of your sushi rolls, which is really cool and fun!  But, for what it's worth, I would view these as completely inedible, the grape flavor is very strong and the texture is...out of this world, like eating alien goo.  But!  That doesn't diminish the fun and novelty because, like eating anything from an Easy Bake Oven or a Doctor Dreadful kit, you don't expect much but it's fun to make, which is the whole point.<br /><br />And one note about the seller--they got it here about 2 weeks earlier than I expected with a handwritten thank you note!

34106,B004N8LMFM,A3F8E90I0Y9TBG,Guumi,0,0,4,1337990400,Very Fun!,"This was my first time ordering a Japanese candy, from Kracie, to be exact. I was so excited to receive it after watching many YouTube videos about it. I must say, it was so much fun to make this! Don't worry if you don't know Japanese, as you can either watch instructional videos from YouTube or follow the pictures, as they are thourough.<br /><br />All of the different ingredients smelled wonderful. The rice smelled like bubblegum. The egg and meat smelled faintly like mango. The seaweed smelled like grape. The fish eggs and soy sauce smelled a bit like mango, but more of a fruitier smell.<br /><br />Now for the taste. I loved the taste of each one, as they weren't overpowering. But the textures are what really displeased me. The rice was really cool because of the feel in my hands, but in your mouth it tastes kind of stiff and grainy. I think that the worst texture was the meat and egg. They were so grainy that I could barely swallow them, and to top it off they were on top of the rice. Yuck!<br /><br />The best taste and texture had to be the fish eggs. They are little gel balls, just like that product from a long time ago that Listerine made. It was breath freshener ""mints"", that were in the gelled ball form, and they exploded with liquid when you bit them, making your mouth feel fresh. I actually ended up saving the fish eggs instead of putting them on the sushi because I liked eating them. Also, the soy sauce and the mixture that you put the fish eggs in tasted wonderful, with that faint fruity taste.<br /><br />The product shipped the day after I order it (standard shipping), and came a week later (the first estimated delivery date). I was very happy about that, especially since it shipped from Japan.<br /><br />Overall, I think if you are considering it, buy it! It is such a fun way to make candy. Just beware of the rice, meat, and egg after you make it!"

Serve with a cold dairy beverage and you have yourself some baked nirvana.<br /><br />I prefer homemade cookies now to the Keebler variety, but if you need a quick fix and don't mind the sugar and calories, then you could do a lot worse than these elven concoctions. They get 2 thumbs up from my kids as well!<br /><br />~ Kort"

I stopped feeding him this dog food and bought organic.  My dog started eating again and stopped throwing up. I will not be buying this dog food anymore."

To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive."

I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified.

My Yorkie Loved it! I was really surprised.  He eats every bite.  It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.

It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard."

These cost more than ordinary chews and I'm not sure they are any healthier for their teeth and gums than the plain rawhide chews.  One of my dogs is prone to gum disease and often has bad breath, if these worked as advertised, her gums would be healthier and bad breath should be eliminated by the enzyme action.  I've tried giving the dogs nothing but this brand of chews for over a month and there was no detectable improvement.

If your dog does not chew this product and just gulps it down, then it won't be beneficial to his oral care.  Also, as with ANY product that can be chewed or ingested, please monitor your pet while they are eating/chewing this product.  Overall this is a great product, I will continue to order it for my dog.  This product does not replace routine dental care, but it is part of a dental care routine.  The reason I sound so ""informercial"" is becasue I actually work in the animal care field.  The practice that I used to work for stopped carrying this brand and switched to a cheaper brand. ICK.

I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds, 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.

I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of ""is this useful votes"" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.

Their teeth are definitely with less plaque and tartar, but then we use bully sticks and enzyme in their water.  Our dogs teeth are very white but not sure which product is working the most.  I think they love the bully sticks the most which we buy from Costco because they are a fraction of what they cost in a pet store or online(these dogs don't eat just anything and are very particular about what goes in their mouths).

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews","I have purchased this product before as my dogs' vet highly recommends enzyme chews to maintain dental health. I have 2 older beagles. The male's gums are in worse shape and he doesn't like to chew anything, so I soak these chews for a few hours and then he will chew them. The female loves these chews and devours them. The chews aid in breath freshening and tarter removal, but I also use an enzyme toothpaste periodically. As our pets live longer we must do more to help them maintain a healthier life style. My only negative comment is that the chews in the same bag come in many different sizes and thicknesses. (Neither of my dogs like the really thick pieces.) I would prefer a more uniform size as the prices and amounts for the same brand vary so much."

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for over 3 months.  I've consulted with my Vet, Animal Shelter, and Obedience Trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years; ALL agreed that this is a good and safe product BUT like anything else you give you puppy/dog SHOULD be supervised AND timed.  They also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10-20 minutes and either taken away for future use, or the remainder thrown away.  If you are a SMART pet owner, you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes, the product is beginning to be swallowed, I guess it makes sense to take the product away.  These work exactly for what they are intended, to reduce and remove tarter and plaque.  It is NOT a treat or toy!  As much as it CAN be digested, yes, some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke.  As pet owners, again, supervision is needed.  Remember, I have TWO pups, and after 15-20 minutes, all I need to say is ""drop it"" and they listen and do so because I am also a RESPONSIBLE pet owner and have already begun training them to listen.  If the chews aren't too badly mangled, I save for the next/another day, otherwise, they get trashed.  The only other note I will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size/shape of these chews.  Great product otherwise."

I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. Most of the pieces are thinner but still last a good day of chewing. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. For the Enzymatic half the time I have to use a knife to cut it. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Now im stuck with a big bag of CET Enzymatic that my dog no longer likes because she prefers the HEXtra.

Anytime my dog has had one of the thicker ones, she has always vomited it up several hours later.  I contacted the co about this, and they said they're aware of this problem, and are changing the supplier.  I have continued to buy them and throwing away the thick ones, 10-30% of the bag over a period of several months, and the problem continues.  They are too expensive to throw so many away.

It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.<br /><br />I think that in theory, enzyme-assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the toothbrushes/toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard.<br />I think I will stick with tooth-brushing followed by a small mint-flavored treat to reward the toothbrushing.<br /><br />I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide/toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to breaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece.

I had originally bought them for the sole purpose of promoting good dental health, thinking my dog might chew on them if he got bored or if it was the only chew I gave him. You see, he's usually very picky- he won't chew antlers or bones, unflavored rawhide, nylabones, and though he'll lick peanut butter out of a kong, he doesn't do much if I put a treat in there.  To my surprise, as soon as my dog smells these chews, he can hardly control himself, he get so excited! They smell a little funky (meaty), but I think that's all part of what makes my dog love these chews.<br /><br />This is great for us, since it means he gets an after-dinner treat he loves, they have helped keep his teeth relatively plaque free, and they help keep his breath from smelling bad. Of course, his mouth doesn't exactly smell like your favorite flower (unless your favorite flower smells like dog breath), but I have noticed that the distance at which I start to smell my dog's stinky dog-breath has shortened significantly, and his breath no longer causes people distress from a distance. Also nice is that these chews last a little while. For my dog, they will keep him occupied for around 15 minutes. This is great compared to the Kong brand fresh breath treats, which my dog chewed through right away, and they did very little for his teeth.<br /><br />To address other reviewers' comments, I should caution that my dog is somewhat small at 30lbs, and he is an incredibly patient chewer (though he will chew for very long periods of time). He will calmly chew his rawhides, etc, until he gets nice small pieces to swallow, and he avoids pieces that are too big to swallow, so these treats present little choking hazard for him. I understand the issue though, and I'd recommend that you treat these like any other thin rawhide squares, which is to say that they are a pretty big hazard for choking or for your dog swallowing large un-chewed pieces (which can cause an upset tummy). As with any rawhide-type treat, you should supervise your dog when you give these to them, especially the first few times. My biggest complaint of these chews is that I think they would last longer and be less of a choking hazard if they came as twists or rolls, instead of flat pieces, since the flat pieces are pretty easy to break.<br /><br />Since too much of a good thing is usually a bad thing, I also try to limit the number of these chews I give to my dog, since they appear to very similar to beef hide, and I don't want to give him too many hide chews. So, I give him one of these every other day, depending on the other treats he has had that day, and I alternate with greenies or other dental-type chews, so he has a variety of chews, but he gets some sort of dental health chew every day."

He doesn't chew on ANYTHING really. I mean, as a puppy he chewed the wall once, but we sprayed that with some of that nasty tasting spray stuff and since then, no problem.<br /><br />He used to love to chew on cow hooves, but for some reason he just seems to enjoy licking them now (maybe he likes the pasture flavorings). He doesn't chew any of his chew toys.<br /><br />So how do you clean a dog's teeth if they don't chew on anything? The answer is brushing (which is always good regardless of whether your dog chews or not!) and not much else.<br /><br />While at the vet I saw the CET Enzymatic HEXTRA Premium chews. $30 a bag for 30 chews. It seemed excessive, but to keep from having to put Baird through the scary procedure of a full teeth cleaning, it seems a small price to pay. My fear was he wouldn't chew on them. Turns out... he LOVES them!<br /><br />The thing is, the $30 price tag really got me, so I decided to try to find something a little cheaper, when I happened upon Amazon and found the ""one step down from top of the line"" Virbac (makers of the CET chews), ""C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews."" It's not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don't have).<br /><br />And it turns out Baird loves these as well.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won't fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so brushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that's what can cause health problems with your dogs.<br /><br />Over all, I'm happy that Baird's happy with these chews. If you can't brush your dog's teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to brushing. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K7W"">C.E.T.

I can see how it works as a teeth cleaning agent as she can get about 5-10 minutes of chewing on it until she is finished.<br /><br />Because I never want to see it become a choking hazard I do only let her eat these in my presence and do not leave them as a treat when I leave in her crate.

Although we give them rawhide regularly, their teeth are still funky. We just went through our first bag of these chews, and the teeth on all three dogs have improved. We like them so much that I just ordered another three bags.<br /><br />Regarding the choking hazard, all dogs need to chew, so you need to give them things so they can. Some dogs attempt to swallow pieces that are too large, and so they gag. As a dog owner, you MUST monitor your dog while it's chewing. Even dogs that gag usually learn after the first couple of times, so they don't gag again. But you still need to monitor your dog while they're chewing.

Reading other reviews about this product confirmed my suspicions that this was not a rare occurrence. One should always monitor and supervise their dogs when they are chewing something whether it is a toy or a treat, however, you should not expect your dog to choke on a chew treat under otherwise normal circumstances.

Whether it be a rawhide, cow ear, meaty femur or even a stuffed KONG toy.  Dogs that love to chew & can eat a rawhide in a matter of minutes, should not be permitted to have rawhide because they are considered ""aggressive chewers"".  This does not mean that they are mean or naughty dogs, but more that they are persistent.  These dogs should only be allowed to chew on KONG toys or Nylabone (non-flexible) chews.  I have an aggressive chewer myself & those are the only toys he plays with for chewing purposes.<br /><br />I also have a non-aggressive chewer.  He will carry a stuffed toy in his mouth wherever he goes, he's not interested in ripping it to shreds.  He will only chew a rawhide or Nylabone for a few minutes before he gets bored.  Rawhides are safer for these types of dogs because they won't try to eat the piece whole, even still, supervision is a must.<br /><br />Please take into consideration what kind of chewer you have prior to purchasing this product.  With that said, this is a great product in that it promotes dental health!  They're a tasty treat for our four-legged family members and for those of us that don't have the time to brush our dog's teeth, they do what we can't."

I've found this much less stressful on the fish when dealing with a 'dirty or diseased or medicated' fish tank. Changing the water (especially after meds) can sometimes create such a harmful blow on the fish... whereas this is so much more gentle on the fish; thus allowing a water change after-the-fact without the incredible stress or damage to delicate fish. Even if you're in need of adding meds, I've found this a fabulous 'pre-intervention' -- why, because many times this need only occurs due to lack of proper maintenance of the tank. By alleviating the 'nasties' before a small water change + adding meds; I personally have found this a lifesaver when it comes to those fish in 'not-to-happy' condition.

I've never used it on pasta because I don't care for pasta.  But I use it as a seasoning. It's less heavy than the pestos that come in jars (that often have cheese already in them---thus not the high quality cheese I'd prefer). If I want this pesto spiked up with parmesan, I'll use a very good cheese--and it then makes a very good pesto!"

I bought a Keurig and Breville machine for convenience. I generally use the ""My K cup"" and grind my own beans. At the office, however, I do use packaged K cups. I prefer a stronger brew, but a medium roast. So far I have found Wolfgang Puck's Vienna Coffee House blend to be very nice. The Caribou Blend was too weak for my taste. This morning I used 2 k cups for 1 mug. It was stronger, but lacked any real flavor. On another point, I wish there was some consistency or change in language when k cups are described as bold. Too many people thing that means a dark roast. It does not. I see so many people comment that bold is roasted too dark for their taste (like Starbucks). Bottom line .... I'll use 2 k cups of the Caribou Blend until I use the 2 boxes I have, then it's back to Wolfgang."

I enjoy flavored coffees but sometimes just want a plain old coffee, and this is THE ONE for me. After having experimented with many others, I will stick with this one."

Got a new shipment in and I noticed a color change on the K-cup, orange to light green. Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on ""we listen to our customers"" and more corporate-speak BS."

This coffee is very smooth but loaded with flavor, even on the largest cup setting.  I was taken aback when I took my first sip; the subtle hint of berry and chocolate was so pleasant.

Ever since, I've required milk and sugar in my coffee as that's how I knew coffee. Drinking any coffee black was not the most appealing experience, until Cairbou. I've had Caribou coffee before the K-Cups and I'm a fan of their flavor, which is captured very well. Brewing this in 8-10oz cup sizes will give you the best flavor, and best of all, you won't need to have milk and sugar around all the time.<br /><br />There's no argument against the convenience and quality of a Keurig, and the Caribou Blend may be the best available, meaning little slices of heaven in each cup. The only downside is cost, which exists with all K-Cups. However, even at about $0.66 every 10-11oz, it's still cheaper than my neighborhood coffee shop AND it's in my own kitchen. Worth every penny.<br /><br />There are other great brands out there, but this flavor is the first to really stand on its own merits with me, and I feel like I need to pass that along."

Slicher ""psych303""",15,15,5,1274918400,Excellent Allergy Response!,"My 10 year old cocker spaniel has been treated for chronic ear and paw yeast infections for the past 9 years.  He's had chronic, stinky black gunk in his ears and a black waxy substance covering his toes.  I would guess that I've spent thousands of dollars on vet visits, tests, shampoos, ear medications, wipes, antibiotics - you name it - none of which worked for more than a week.  My vet even tried a ""new"" process where the dog's ears were filled with some type of medication every week (at the vets - $50 a week) for a couple of months - but there was no improvement.  My poor dog has scratched himself raw and spent much of his day licking and digging at his yeast-encrusted paws or scratching his sore, smelly ears.  Recently, I've been bathing him every 2 days with Malaseb Shampoo (which did seem to help), but he had to stand for 15 minutes with the shampoo covering him, before the medication could be rinsed from his skin.  Poor little dog.<br /><br />While on a trip to Florida, I took my spaniel to a new vet who prescribed more ear drops, wipes, and shampoo in an attempt to help my dog.  The vet  asked me if I'd ever tried changing his food from Eukanuba, which he's been on since he was a puppy.  No vet had ever mentioned that my dog could be allergic to his food and it seemed so simple.  I found Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison at Petco and thought I'd try a food trial.  What a difference!  In the two weeks since he's been on this dog food his yeast infection appears to be gone.  His ears are clear, with no discharge or irritation and the skin on his paws is starting to look pink and healthy.  I can't believe the difference in such a short time!  He's not scratching, either.  The Florida vet had said that a food trial would require at least 2 months, but I'm seeing such an improvement in only 2 weeks.  Pretty amazing!"

Titan's vomiting and dry heaves have decreased dramatically since being on this food (he's been on it for about 1.5 months now). Yay! Since it worked so well for him, I decided to try it on one of my other dogs, a PBGV with major stinky anal gland issues. Even though I hadn't read any reviews about this food working for that, I thought it was worth a shot. I was told that more fiber in his diet might help to bulk up his stool and this food seemed to have more fiber. Jack has been on this food for about a month now and we haven't had any stinky anal gland issues so far. My only issue with this food is the price (a 110-pound dog goes through it like crazy).

Then we discovered Natural Balance.  On a price per pound basis it's about half the price. Our dog has done very well with this food.  Although there is no way for me to be sure, I also think it's likely that sweet potato is more nutritious than plain potato, so that's another benefit.  If you buy from Amazon there is free shipping and no sales tax, as well.<br />The food is a little more dense, so if you're switching from Royal Canin you might want to weigh your regular feeding of the old food, and determine how much of a scoop of the new food gives the same weight.

The dog simply will not eat it. I tried everything I could think of to get him to eat it: mixed in a little olive oil (which usually does the trick for him with other food; didn't work), mixed it with grated cheese (somehow the dog managed to eat just the cheese), mixed it with yogurt (he begs for anything that's dairy; no dice), mixed it turkey grease after browning ground turkey (he ate 2 bites, and that was it). I even ate a kibble of it myself just to see, and honestly it didn't taste that bad, kind of like very bland, grainy-vegetable granola. So, I figured that when he got hungry enough, he'd eat it. For 3 days he ate nothing, and finally on day 4, I broke down and bought other food."

My vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula worked quite well for us, but we could tell that our pug was looking for some variety so we tried their Sweet Potato and Venison formula.<br /><br />According to the Natural Balance web site, some dogs develop sensitivities to commonly used proteins, carbohydrates, and food additives. This may cause stomach and intestinal problems, as well as skin irritations. In our dog's case, it was his red irritated skin on his belly that led us to try a limited ingredient diet. The Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Venison formula combines fresh venison, a source of animal protein that most dogs have not been exposed to, and sweet potato, premium quality carbohydrate rich in potassium and a highly digestible energy source. Other key ingredients include canola oil, low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fat, as well as an excellent source of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids, along with flaxseed, another quality source of Omega-3 fatty acids. The food is completely grain free (no barley, wheat, rice or corn) and contains no artificial colors or flavors.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. My pug is able to eat it easily, although in his case, he pretty much inhales his food and doesn't chew it much. It has a slight meaty smell, which I think he likes, as the Potato and Duck formula didn't seem to have much of an enticing scent.<br /><br />My local specialty pet food store tells me this is #1 selling dog food. I can see why! Our pug continues to do well with this LID formula, just like he did with Potato & Duck. His skin shows no sign of redness and irritation, and just as importantly, it appears to agree well with his stomach. He doesn't get gassy and his stool is not loose or showing any other signs of intestinal distress. It also appears to keep his appetite under control as he doesn't beg for so many treats between meals and doesn't start asking for dinner so early as he did with some other foods in the past. If it keeps him happy and itch-free, then we're happy, too. 5 stars."

It's not related to the other deaths.<br /><br />[...]<br />Natural Balance Pet Foods,® Inc. Issues A Voluntary Nationwide Recall on Specific Venison Dog & Cat Food Products<br /><br />Contact:<br />Consumer Inquiries:<br />(800) 829-4493<br />Media Inquiries:<br />Daniel Bernstein<br />310-275-0777<br /><br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Pacoima, CA -- April 17, 2007-- Natural Balance, Pacoima, CA, is issuing a voluntary nationwide recall for all of its Venison dog products and the dry Venison cat food only, regardless of date codes. The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.<br /><br />The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.<br /><br />Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.<br /><br />The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.<br />No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.<br /><br />Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e-mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.<br /><br />The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.<br /><br />We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.<br /><br />Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-829-4493 or email [...]<br /><br />another one:<br /><br />Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007<br /><br />Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:<br /><br />Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz<br /><br />There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.<br /><br />To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co-manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate."

So, I brewed this coffee in the same manner as I usually do, with a high-end coffee maker, and it was not good. It had a very, very bitter taste. Like I said, I brewed it the same as I always brew my coffee, added the same creamer, and it was horrible. I tried it again and again, over the course of a week, trying to get better results but it just never got better. This coffee tasted like cheap diner coffee and I was unhappy with it. I emailed Cafe Altura to let them know that I was unhappy with the coffee and would like a refund, and received the most rude email back from the president of the company. I mean, I was shocked! The president basically told me that my experience with Cafe Altura was not his problem and that he would not offer me a refund. I kindly explained my whole brewing experience, and that I was not happy with the coffee, and that I simply wanted to bring this to his attention. I was very polite in my emails with him and received snarky marks, uncaring and condescending put-downs and an ego trip. I was truly shocked by the level of customer service from the president of the company. After explaining my experience, and receiving a few rude emails, my email responses went unanswered. I again, politely, asked for a refund and to date my emails are now being ignored.

I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth, were spicy, but more flavor than I expected.  So I ate a couple more.  Then the heat intensity starts to kick in. Unlike other habanero foods, this one had a bit of a creeper affect rather than hitting you like a freight train from the beginning.  Then my mouth started to burn and the tears started rolling.  God, how I love that feeling.  Sadistic, I know. They really do make you feel alive.  I keep several bags at work so I can have something to get over the afternoon hump around 3 pm.  They do the job well as I get a level of alertness that caffeine just can't deliver.  It also makes me appear like a more sensitive guy since I am crying the whole time.  Eating these chips has also produced a nice side effect for me - I am unbelievably hydrated throughout the day.  My skin has never looked better.  The only warning I would give when eating these chips is that the pepper powder they use is extremely light. So when you pop them in your mouth, you will inevitably get some up your nose via your nasopharynx.  It will make you sniffle like a coke addict from the 80s. A bit annoying but great for clearing up sinuses. Oh yeah, my best advice is that you should really wash your hands thoroughly before using the bathroom - like 2-3 times.

I can't stop eating because these are so good.<br />Definitely have milk around to help the heat factor.  I now have my boyfriend hooked and a fan.

It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.

I also went online to research the food and found a number of alarming reviews where dogs had reactions to the food.  Of course, there could be outside circumstances involved in these other instances, so I also made sure to read all the positive reviews.  However, this was clearly not working for my dog.  To settle my concerns around the negative reviews however, I decided to call the company.  It turns out that quite a few dogs are sensitive to sweet potatoes, and also, possibly, peas, which is also an ingredient in this food.  They were super nice, and sent me a voucher for a free bag of treats, and a voucher for a full size replacement bag of food in any of their other varieties, to be redeemed at any pet store that carries their product!

I was delighted to see that Amazon had larger tins.<br /><br />Since it has been a while since I've purchased Coleman's in any size, I was totally unprepared for the size of these containers.

They're fairly well packed and all three tins seemed to be sealed, but there was a substantial amount of spicy yellow dust inside the package and one tin was dented.  Some leakage and a dent are not deal breakers by any means.<br /><br />As far as the product itself goes, if you have a taste for spicy foods, Coleman's mustard is the bomb!  It will clear your sinuses and bring tears to your eyes.  If you mix up a quantity ahead of time, it will mellow in the fridge, but then what's the point?

The Woodstock Farms organic Pine Nuts are some of the best I have used and eaten. I always saute then in either olive oil or butter, then mix them in recipes or with rice and couscous. They give a delectable flavor, and add a great deal to any food.<br /><br />''Pine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are frequently added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread. In Italian they are called pinoli (in the U.S. they are often called ""pignoli"" but in Italy ""pignolo"" is actually a word far more commonly used to describe a fussy, overly fastidious or extremely meticulous person)[10] and are an essential component of Italian pesto sauce. Pignoli cookies, an Italian American specialty confection (in Italy these would be called ""biscotti ai pinoli""), are made of almond flour formed into a dough similar to that of a macaroon and then topped with pine nuts. In Spain, a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts, painted with egg and lightly cooked. Pine nuts are also featured in the salade landaise of southwestern France. Pine nut coffee, known as pi&ntilde;&oacute;n (Spanish for pine nut), is a speciality found in the southwest United States, especially New Mexico, and is typically a dark roast coffee having a deep, nutty flavour; roasted and lightly salted pine nuts can often be found sold on the side of the road in cities across New Mexico to be used for this purpose, as well as a snack. The Nevada, or Great Basin, pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is relished for its large size, sweet flavor and ease of peeling.""

I must say that Maruchan is the best brand of this type of meal of the 2 brands of similar prices in stores IMO (this and Nissin Chow Mein), and this flavor is great. To me it tastes more like a teriyaki than just soy sauce.. I think it has a very slight spiciness and sweetness.<br />In Maruchan Yakisoba there are always plenty of vegetables (unless you get the cheese flavored meals), and I especially like that this flavor has the wider flat noodles instead of the round ones. I tried one plain when they arrived and another one  I added cooked shrimp to. I think this would be good with added cooked beef, chicken, or pork too, but you're not missing out at all if you just make it the way it comes without adding any thing.<br /><br />These would also be good to have in case of an emergency because the noodles seem to be pre-cooked and only require re-hydration. you could make it by just pouring boiling water (or the hottest water available) in, covering well, and letting it sit for a little while,  stirring it a couple of times while you wait to get all of the noodles and vegetables into the hot water. Cold water might work but it would probably take a long time to re-hydrate every thing.<br /><br />Another thing you could do if you have plain ramen noodle soup packets around the house that aren't getting eaten and you don't have quite the right shaped bowls to cook them in the microwave is save the trays from these and use them. It says on the package not to reuse the tray, but I think that is for liability reasons. I have yet to melt one from reusing it. What I like to do is put the noodle block into the bowl, add meat and/or a bit of small frozen vegetables like corn and peas, fill water to just under the line and cook until the noodles are done, then add the seasoning packet. I find the full ramen soup packet is too salty for me some times though so if you do this, I would add some at a time until it suits your taste."

Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.

Everyone has their own heat tolerance level and I would say that this salsa does warm up your mouth, could possibly cause your nose to run but has a vinegary jalapeno taste that is unmatched by any other commercial tomatillo hot sauce that can be sourced locally at your neighborhood grocery store and/or Wal-Mart.  While I try to share my business amongst various grocery stores and markets in the town I live in, I believe my Wal-Mart sells this for less than $3 for a 1kg/35oz bottle.  I love to put this on frozen burritos and it is awesome with tortilla chips.  I was actually introduced to this salsa by a Cuban-American family that we are friends with and they always have it on standby for the congris (black beans and rice) that the mom of the family makes.  And really, unless you have a garden with tomatillos, jalapenos etc. at your disposal, can you really make it for less than your local store might sell it for? Anyway, I rate it highly even though my gabacho palate is still adjusting to the uncountable number of salsas that are out there."

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn."

I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

Smothers ""All who wander are not lost...""",5,5,5,1232755200,Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping."

Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product."

Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

Khannah-Brown""",2,2,5,1191801600,"Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea","****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****"
34811,B000I1RHMU,A80FGKFCA5SUL,C. Price,4,5,5,1327017600,This compares to chamomile tea,"I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it."

We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit ""add to cart"" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought ""oh, boy"" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The ""burnt"" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . ."

I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed."

This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a ""burnt"" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away."

I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ"">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of ""tea time,"" where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic ""bite"" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.

The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.

When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.

Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking.

How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea.

I find that too many American-produced green teas are ""watered down"" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing.

Peppered is always a safe flavor to try since few makers can screw that up, and this one did not disappoint - very nice balance of pepper and smoke without downing it in salt.  the Hickory tasted like pickled meat with a strong dill and parsley aftertaste, while being way too salty and moist.  both had about the same gristle percentage than that cheap import Amazon sells from World Kitchens Jerky.  If you like your Jerky drier, just leave it in the fridge in an open bag for a few days.

That's how beef jerky is supposed to be. The flavor was also really bad, but that is probably from the mold. I think the issue is the moisture. It makes it tender, but it is also leading to the mold issues a lot of people are experiencing. I won't order this brand again, which is a shame because it was a great price for the amount of jerky."

Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else."

It arrived quickly, as usual for Amazon, and it tastes good.  But, it's not ""all-natural with no chemical preservatives"" unless you consider sodium nitrite and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil to fall under that description.  I would consider ordering it again if it weren't for the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />How do they get away with suggesting that there are no artificial preservatives (sodium nitrite) in this stuff?

Were they in fact made of beef or cowboy? Since cannibalism hasn't generally been in practice for quite some time (and even when it was, only by savages of the worst sort), I felt it was quite likely that the 'beef' mentioned in the title was the meat source, but it wasn't out of the realm of possibility to believe these to be beef flavored COWBOY strips made from real life cowboys. That thought caused my stomach to turn, and because I take great pride in leading a cannibalism free lifestyle, I decided it might be wise to contact the manufacturers of WILD RIDE just to double check--similarly I once contacted the makers of the very confusingly named 'chicken of the sea' brand tuna fish to see if it was chicken or fish; quite an important distinction! Better safe than sorry over having broken my nearly 30 year streak of cannibalism avoidance in one fell swoop, I gave WILD RIDE a call!<br /><br />Thankfully, WILD RIDE confirmed that this was in fact BEEF jerky, and that the Cowboy reference in the title was just an adjective explaining the sort of jerky it is: long, thin strips that are chewable, soft, and very, very tasty. I suggested that they rename it ""Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips (NOT MADE FROM COWBOYS. NO COWBOYS INJURED IN THE MAKING OF THIS JERKY)"" and they agreed such a change could potentially be useful. Much obliged for their assistance in understanding their product and their intentions (after all if they WERE selling COWBOY jerky, it might call into question what sort of operation they run, and if they are in-fact a Zombie enterprise!) I was able to enjoy all four bags of this jerky in about 30 minutes. Wishing I had more, I took a stroll to the outhouse because I suddenly wasn't feeling that well, and the next thirty minutes I spent thinking about what a great movie you could make about a Zombie owned corporation selling COWBOY JERKY to the unknowing public. I couldn't decide if I'd prefer to have Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal play the protagonist (or possibly pair them up!) or if the ending would involve a nuclear warhead wiping out the zombies or just let Chuck and Stev-o whack them apart with machetes, but at least these unanswered questions successfully distracted me from the 3.1 magnitude earthquake that was shaking the entire outhouse.<br /><br />So put your mind at ease: these are BEEF strips made in the cowboy fashion, and they're very, very tasty!"

It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again.
