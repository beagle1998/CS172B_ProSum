All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.

I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is.

20112,B002GUM582,A1AK9OL3ZOAZ7X,Penn State 29,1,1,5,1292025600,Great Product,Have wanted to try squid ink for some time now.  Ordered this product and made a seafood risotto with it.  It came out fantastic!!!!! Would highly recommend.
20113,B002GUM582,A7VN9XJY36BJA,Sara Powell,0,0,5,1331164800,Thank goodness for the internet,"I used this squid ink for a recipe out of Ferran Adria's new Family Meal cookbook.  I had to buy on Amazon since apparently no one in Dallas has ever heard of or carried squid ink in their stores.  Thank goodness for online ordering!<br /><br />I used two of the four packets for the recipe (for 2 servings of squid risotto), and it dissolved into the fish stock pretty easily.  I was expecting any stray droplets to permanently stain my counter, but that didn't happen.  It wipes up easily.  The taste was good...kind of salty and milder than I expected.  I've never had squid ink before, so I can't tell if this product is better or worse than others, but I liked it and the dish turned out well.  I'm just glad that I didn't need much more for the recipe since this product could get a little pricey in larger quantities."

The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a slightly bitter dark roast coffee taste with the right amount of sugar and a pleasant mouthfeel.

So, when I found the vanilla chai mix on Amazon, I simply had to have it.  Aside from the fact that all I could do with my milk is microwave or boil it, this mix is absolutely heavenly.  For Chai purists who are used to the traditional way of making chai, this may not be necessarily your first choice, but for those of us amateurs, it offers a quick fix.  My only suggestion is, if you happen to be lucky enough to own an espresso machine that can foam your milk, make sure you do so as it seems to be what added the additional body that I enjoyed at the coffee cart but failed to reproduce at home."

It has a nutty, chewy taste and lots of flavor.  I am at high altitude and have to add more water and cook longer, but that is common with grains up here.  I have added loads of Porcini (Boletus edulis) to it and it stands alone by itself.  I have also served it with a chicken curry and it compliments it wonderfully.<br /><br />The only drawback is that there is no nutrition information on it - the label is blank.

Actually, the packaging was a little tough because they were tightly wrapped with some kind of plastic wrap. And although I'm not an expert it's hard for me to testify that the juniper is actually 4 years old. To my amateur eyes it looks to be much younger.<br /><br />The elm has lost a few leaves yellowing and falling but after a few Internet searches I learned why this is happening. The pots were as I expected and I believe them to be of nice quality. The box also had a green bottle of fertilizer which I wasn't expecting but it was nice and I appreciate it.<br /><br />I think it would have been better if the seller would have included a complementary brochure for Bonsai related products such as humidity trays. The reason I say this is because I am a novice and upon initially ordering I had no clue that such things were needed to help Bonsai thrive. At least with a complementary brochure I could have looked through it and say ""Hmm, what is a humidity tray for?"" and would have gotten around to getting a few sooner.<br /><br />I have had both Bonsai for almost two weeks and neither appear to be dying or on the fringes of dying. And considering this is Winter it's supposed to be the dormant season so I don't expect much activity until Spring.<br /><br />I would buy again from this seller."

This is my first bonsai, and I can already tell you it isnt a houseplant or even an outdoor plant. Its a lot close to a pet. You need to check in on it at least once a day. Other things Ive learned: To water it, use a mister bottle and saturate the foliage until it ""rains"" on the soil enough to water it. DO NOT put in direct sunlight when the foliage is wet. Also, it likes direct sunlight in the morning hours, but not during midday. I keep mine where it receives direct sunlight until about 1130am.

I ordered another juniper from Lousbonsai and received a juniper in excellent packaging and 5 times larger for LESS ! Lou also sent instructions to call him immediately after receiving so he can educate a bit and to call ANYTIME. 9greenbox says if problems, take it to your nearest nursery and ask for advice.

Needless worry! The bonsai tree was perfect; its branches were a deep green, it was planted in a black ceramic bonsai dish and included a rock. It had been packaged very well so that the soil was still damp and no branches injured during transport. The company included a sheet of very helpful instructions and a free bottle of liquid fertilizer.

The tree i got was smaller than i expected it to be. But i dont know much about bonsais. And it came in a cream pot with moss. Which i love. SO when ordering a bonsai try not to get your hopes up because like i said each is different. THe one in the picture is just for to show you the type. For a four year old the price is pretty resonible. Most go in the thousands.

We have drunk Irish breakfast tea for many years, and this is an excellent blend, especially for a bag (which makes it easier).  Other brands we've tried in stores are weak imitations of the type because they tend to cut the blend with cheaper black tea in order to make a higher profit.  ToH doesn't do that and the rich flavor speaks for itself.  This tea is a definite flavorful replacement for coffee... just add cream or evaporated milk... mmmmmm...<br /><br />Do the math on this 6 box x 50 bag count and compare with what you see in stores.

It is extremely difficult to find a good domestic black tea within the U.S. (The U.S. is a coffee country, not a tea country - and herbal tea is not real tea!!!).  Black tea within the U.S. is generally weak, watered down and has no taste.  I was pleasantly surprised by this brand of teas (Taylor's of Harrogate in general).  All of the teas that I have tried of this brand have been good, but the Irish breakfast tea in particular is excellent (for packaged tea).  It is a wonderful blend of African and Assamese black teas, with a bold, strong flavor and color.  It is excellent with milk and sugar.

I recently had a heart problem and my cardiologist recommended that I significantly decreae my caffeine intake.  I used to drink several glasses of iced tea every day. Strangely enough tea has at least as much caffeine as coffee.  Green tea is definately out as an alternative to coffee or other beverages; but black tea is fine.I picked up some store brand black tea bags (Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Chai)to make iced tea and I was quite pleased with the heartiness of the flavor.  I then researched the matter further and came accross the Taylor's Decaffeinated Irish Breakfast Tea.  I was quite disappointed with the results.  I like strong tea, and must use at least 14 tea bags to get the same results as 10 tea bags of the store brand.  As you might guess the store brand ia a lot less expensive.

I eventually it at William and Sonoma but it was $10 more and tasted slightly different; less sweet. Anyway, I decided to order the Tiger Spice thinking it would be just as good. I WAS WRONG! It was horrible! It tasted like it had an artificial sweetener in it (my opinion). The texture of the powder was also different from previous David Rio teas I had purchased.

In fact, they're really no different than the run-of-the-mill soft dog treats that you can buy for half the price. One thing I always loved about the Cesars line is that their dog food actually smells palatable. It doesn't just have a meat-like aroma but a meaty aroma...a big difference. The same difference in quality can't be found in the treats though. Upon opening, I was at once overcome by a strong, acrid and chemical-like aroma. Upon examining the treat up-close, I found it to be waxy, sweetish smelling, and so chock full of preservatives that the fumes made my nose itch. The picture on the package shows a white filling surrounded by meaty goodness. The truth is that the filling is barely noticeable...whatever it is. My dogs would have nothing to do with it. I gave the package to a neighbor who feeds her dogs Ol' Roy treats which resemble these in texture and smell and they loved them. Nothing wrong with Ol' Roy btw...but why pay three times the price for the same thing?"

Khannah-Brown""",1,1,5,1175040000,Intense Ginger Experience and Digestive Aid,"*****<br /><br />This Organic Ginger Tea from Yogi Tea is ideal as a digestive aid, and it also purportedly enhances circulation. It's a lovely, intense, all natural herbal tea made from organic ginger root, organic lemon grass, orgnaic licorice root, organic peppermint leaf, and organic black pepper. The taste is exactly like ginger, spicy and peppery, with sweet overtones. It's very nice anytime, but especially after a meal.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginger Organic Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Our 100% Organic Ginger tea has something to offer to anyone who wants to get or stay healthy. For millennia, herbalists from all over the world have known of the healing, soothing and energizing qualities of this root, considered the ""universal medicine.""  Organic Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used worldwide as a safe and mild home remedy for a variety of conditions, including motion sickness, occasional upset stomach and intestinal gas, as well as minor menstrual cramps. Ayurvedic practitioners have used Ginger for years as a way of activating the body's fire element (Agni), which burns up Ama (the body's toxins, comprised of both undigested food and naturally occurring toxins). When Ama is decreased, the body gains strength, balance and harmony. As a natural warming energizer, Ginger is also known to support the immune system, promote rapid and complete digestion and increase intestinal tone and peristalsis.  Furthermore, it works as an antioxidant and has been shown to safely and effectively relieve nausea associated with motion. Our 100% Organic Ginger tea tastes delicious and provides the highest quality of a timeless remedy.""<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that if you have indigestion or heartburn that persists you should see a doctor. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

Chappie is less picky, but he can turn up his nose at some supermarket brand cat foods. So more often then not I buy the canned cat food at petshops (or on Amazon). I fed them each of the cans in the Variety Pack...and its as if the food vanished off the face of the earth within a few minutes.

It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.

I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.

When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!"

ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable."

The food is not overly processed and I am happy to feed this to my cats. When I saw that it was made in Thailand, I was a bit wary as we all have heard about the melamine in, well, everything, in China. Then reading further, I saw the company addresses this and says that the food doesn't use Chinese products.  They seem a thoughtful company at the least, which when it comes to pets, goes a long way with me.<br /><br />As good as the food may seem to me, they are the ones that have to eat it.

I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the ""sauce"" and you might have something here."

The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually ""sesame"". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese ""Sesame"" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor, multi-pack design."

This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day.

On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again.

No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.

She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them.

I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country's food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled ""Made in Thailand"".  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br /><br />My cats don't eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br /><br />On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br /><br />On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br /><br />Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.  Unfortunately, my cats don't eat it, so I don't plan on buying it again.  I rated it 4 stars for the company's effort...they can't please every cat's taste buds!"

Timmy quickly devoured what appeared to be a delicacy to him.<br /><br />To me, it looked too healthy to appeal to a feline, with its obvious chunks of veggies and solid pieces of meat, nicely moistened by a broth. The can is compact and easy to store and the portion size is just right for one cat's healthy appetite. Normally, a regular can of food like Friskies or Whiskas will only get half eaten, but there was no waste here. The food was polished off with a meticulous licked-clean plate, evidence of Timmy's approval of this latest offering.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is not cheap, but it is on the lower end for the ""gourmet"" cat foods and you get quality ingredients.  Each 4-pack I received also came with coupons worth up to $2 in savings so that is an added bonus.<br /><br />All in all, a good cat food worth it's cost.

Mostly shredded meat.  You can smell the sesame!<br />The Chicken Pot Pie has cubes of white meat in a broth with carrots.  This isn't as filling for the kitties.  They did enjoy the broth a lot!  Later they went back for the meat.  The Chicken Pot Pie would be perfect if for your kitty if you are trying to get kitty to get more liquids in their diet.  One of our males, Door Knob Head, had crystals & blood in his urine.  The vet said it could get really expensive if the first round of treatment didn't work.  It didn't work.  Cats can eventually die from blockage if left untreated.  I researched the condition & got him to drink tons of water.  It fushed him out & he's doing great for many years!  My life would have been a lot easier if I knew about the Chicken Pot Pie.  It would have been the perfect way to get more liquids into him!<br />Each 4 pack box comes with a coupon for $1 off your purchase & if you fill out your info. on that very same coupon, they will mail you another coupon for $1.00 off a future purchase.  Not too shabby!  Yeah, this stuff is pretty darn expensive.

There are no meat by-products and if you know what ""by-products"" are you will be happy about that. The problem is that my cats don't seem to like it nearly as much as the fish flavors.  The four cans have only two varieties and my cats weren't thrilled with either one.  In fact, two of my cats don't like these at all.  The sesame chicken is made up of thin strips of chicken which two of my four cats seem to think is tasty enough.  The chicken pot pie is liked by only one cat.  I think the other cats don't like it because it has too much liquid.  The liquid isn't a gravy but rather a watery broth and there is just too much of it.<br /><br />So before you buy this 24 pack size, you will definitely want to try the 4 pack to see if your cats like it.  If they do then this size pack is quite a savings over the 4-packs so it is worth it. If they don't then you only lost a few dollars."

I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.

I hate getting that cat food smell on my hands!  Blech.  This food is not smelly at all.<br /><br />I like the 3-ounce cans.  I've tried to save some money by getting bigger cans, giving him half and covering and storing the other half for later in the refrigerator, but he doesn't like his food cold (I don't blame him) and it seems to just get wasted.

We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites."

I like that Petite Cuisine is available in small cans, as she never finishes a 6 oz. meal in a single sitting, but wish there was a little plastic lid the right size to fit when she doesn't even finish 3 oz.

The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess).

Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based ""gravy"" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat).

In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they ""slurp"" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in ""wet food"" to avoid urinary type probs.

I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food."

Actually this looks and smells good enough to eat (but I'm not going to try it myself).  So I gave it to all four of our cats when they were not particularly hungry (not at a normal meal time) and they all seemed to enjoy it (even the one that often completely refuses to eat anything but ""crunchies"").<br /><br />Reviewing the label it sounds healthy.  The high taurine content is definitely very healthy for cats.  The only ""fault"" I could imagine is the relatively high price (tiny cans and the fact that it has a high moisture content - the moisture is healthy, but you're paying for water).<br /><br />If you can afford to spoil your cats, give this food a try (be careful your kids don't try to eat it by accident {laugh})."

She's not a particular picky eater, so I can't say much about that. However, she looks to really enjoy this brand of cat food. I have tried some brands of wet food in the past that have made her sick (I know cats seem to have digestive systems that are prone to upsetting!) Petite Cuisine did not have any effect there, and she really enjoyed all the flavors. I don't feed her wet food often, usually just some tuna fish now and then. So, although this food is expensive if you used it at every meal, it is priced about the same as tuna, so it fits my needs perfectly. I'm sure my cat will enjoy the rest of this case, and I can keep the canned tuna to myself for now :-)"

The pieces of fish are large and fresh looking (although I was not tempted to go for the bread and mayo, they smelled good, too). My cats ate every morsel of the food, instead of sucking up the gravy and leaving half the solid to petrify onto the sides of their bowl as they do with other sliced cat foods in sauce.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is pricey, but I think I might keep a carton on hand for occasional special treats.

(And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one."
20345,B001BDDTB2,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""",19,20,5,1227571200,Looks like a winner,"I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it's a minor consideration.  While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe.""  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that's the important thing.  He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to.  I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat."

The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings."

On occasion I will purchase Friskies but honestly I just can't stand the smell of the latter, even if the kitties just love it.<br /><br />Just for a fun little test I decided to put three cans out, to see which was favored by my cats (Fancy Feast, Aristocats and this Petite Cuisine).  Well, long story short, they gobbled this brand up, quick as quick before moving on to their usual favorites.<br /><br />This brand looks and for the most part smells similar to canned tuna, one of them even has tiny whole shrimp. Bonus!! They eat it all up, so no kitty food sitting in the bowl when they are done. It is made from quality ingredients, not full of ash (like some), has added vitamins and the texture & smell that the cats really enjoy.  I admit that quality cat food has gotten a bit on the expensive side but, this isn't bad at all considering the prices of the other comparable brands.

Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.

Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat."

I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me."

We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff!

The food looks like canned fish for humans in sauce--no prefab ""morsels."" The flavor with shrimp actually has little whole shrimp along with the fish chunks.

It seemed overly expensive to me - at first.  the cans are pretty and are only three ounces.  At first, again, that didn't seem like much to me.  But, my preconceived notions went out the window when I saw how my cats loved it.  The pair of kittens kindly took turns eating from one can, but, they scarfed it down and came and begged for more.  The adult cats each have been given one can a day.  These cats NEVER growl at one another, but, when they're eating Petite Cuisine, they growl when another approaches.  They finish each serving, inhaling it like the nectar of the gods.  I'm ashamed that I'd never given this to them before and, despite the somewhat pricey bottom line and small cans, I think that this is one of the most phenomenal gifts that my cats have ever been given."

We usually feed them dry food, but give them the canned stuff once in a while for a treat.  Our large sized male cat LOVES Petite Cuisine, and gobbles it up.  Our dainty little female though, refuses table scraps and won't touch any wet food, including Petite Cuisine.  My kids helped me to take notes on this food as we offered it to both cats.  The same thing happened with every flavor- little cat A sniffed it and walked away, while big fat cat B ate it up as fast as he could! I guess it's all a matter of preference.<br /><br /> I feel good about the fact that this stuff is natural and looks like food.  it is not full of fillers, and it has everything a cat requires for a healthy diet.  The cans are the right size for a single serving for an average to big cat, so there's no messing around with storing half empty cans of fragrant catfood in the fridge."

Our cats especially love the Yellow Fin Tuna, and they eat every last morsel.  Some pieces get left behind with the Red Snapper and the Tuna and Shrimp flavors, however, maybe because the fish pieces are larger (I suppose I could mash it up for them, though.)  The product's packaging promises ""no bad odors,"" and they're really not that bad -- unless you can't stand the smell of fish.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine seems to be kind of spendy; it costs about twice what you'd pay for a can of Friskies, and the cans of Petite Cuisine are smaller.  After giving my cats Petite Cuisine, I went to the grocery store to look at similar cat food products, and discovered there are several very similar items (to P.C.) on the market, and for a lot cheaper.<br /><br />So yes, there are cheaper options.

(Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal."

It is 100% nutritionally complete, with no grain fillers.  When you pop the top on the single-serve can, it looks and smells like exactly what it is -- fish and shrimp.  Obviously, the fish smells like fish, but it's a natural, clean fish smell, not a nasty cat-food odor.  I swear, the steamed tuna and shrimp, with its whole shrimp, looked good enough to set out with crackers for a human appetizer!<br /><br />Although I would feed this food to my cats without hesitation, I felt I had to downgrade it one star because of the cats' opinions.  I fed this to three family cats, and being cats, each had its own opinion, but none endorsed it 100%.  One cat loved the steamed tuna and shrimp, one wouldn't go near it.  One gobbled up the yellowfin tuna, two picked at and left most of it.  My son's cat is notoriously fussy about canned food, and ate only one of these entrees with enthusiasm; my two cats are notoriously unfussy, but ate only two wholeheartedly (however, they usually prefer poultry flavors to fish).<br /><br />Petite Cuisine comes in handy single-serving cans and, as I mentioned, contains excellent ingredients with no foul odor or appearance.  If your cat generally likes fish flavors and you are looking for a high quality, healthy cat food, I would certainly recommend trying Petite Cuisine."

Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- one Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Shrimp Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Steamed Tuna and Sole Entr&eacute;e<br />-- one Yellow Fin Tuna Entr&eacute;e<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included an equal number of each flavor) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the chunks of seafood. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Red Snapper Entr&eacute;e: fish broth, Tuna filets, Red Snapper Fillets, soy bean oil, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Carrageenan, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 13%, crude fat (min) 1.5%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%, taurine (min) 0.1%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on all four flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended."

From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him.

How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />""Meowwwww! Errowwww!"" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.

They all loved this food, especially my outdoors cat.  Unfortunately, my dog liked it even more, and it became a bit of a problem keeping him away while they were eating, and it normally is not a problem.  He is a very picky dog who loves fish, so I could tell by his reaction that the seafood taste was definitely good.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the can, I could see that this food includes real flake tuna - it is not very much different in appearance than Starkist tuna in the can for people.  It does not have that terrible smell that some wet catfoods do, (Like the Meow Mix Wholesome Goodness).  That is nice, because with some catfoods if you open the can and some flys on you, you have to go shower or smell like a fishmarket.  This food is not stinky like that.  It has a good enough smell to excite the cats, but the human noses here did not smell it in our trash or from across the room.<br /><br />I watched my cats closely, and my dog as well, since he got 'into it' and it treated their digestive systems well. Sometimes new food will make them sick, but this food did not in the least.<br />I am only giving this a 4 star because my cats did not finish the red snapper flavor either time I put it down for them.

Some cats don't mind having the same food every day and some cats might not like each flavor so whether to get the variety pack of 24 or the single flavor pack of 24 is up to you and your cat.

The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they're just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don't like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I'm not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they've already complained). The Siamese isn't as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won't eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY"">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I'd try the 'Subscribe & Save' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they're absolutely nuts about it. We call it 'kitty crack' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I'd have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can't get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish 'flavored' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn't have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I'd_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren't equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food.

My cats LOVE the food and refuse to eat other canned food. I have tried to give them more expensive, better quality food but they only want Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />That said, I am quite disappointed at P.C.'s customer service. After researching on menadione, I emailed P.C. and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future. I never heard back from them. Before this, I received an email from them with a coupon code. I tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work. I emailed their CS and they told me that the coupon was working. Come to find out, they misspelled the coupon on the email. The code contained the word ""cuisine"" and they misspelled it. I emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction. Very disappointing indeed...<br /><br />In the future, if I find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service, and I would instantly switch over to the new brand. Well, my cats have to like the new food too, which is why I haven't able to give them something else yet."

20418,B001BDDTB2,ADZ1E2SYWSG99,Chad Myers,3,3,4,1231286400,Cuisine for kitties,"We've gone through all of the flavors now three times.  Both cats chowed down quite happily on the food.  The boy got quite vocal and insistent the next few days about how much he wanted more of the wet food.  Far, far more vocal than he got after getting the 9 Lives canned food before.  Judging from that it seems to be tastier.<br /><br />It definitely looks more appealing to me.  Actual flakes of fish, small shrimp, no unpleasant smell beyond a slight seafood smell.  After putting the food into a bowl the can doesn't look nasty either.  White interior, no discoloration spots.  A quick rinse gets rid of any remaining juices before tossing the can in the recycle bin.<br /><br />Can is made of aluminum, not steel.  Cans are opened with a pull-tab, no can opener required.  The other cat food we had varied; some flavors had a tab on the can to open it and others required a can opener.  In our house it's much nicer when it has a tab to open.  Otherwise I had to go hunting for the can opener after pulling the bowls out of the cupboard.  And of course the cats heard the clang of the bowls coming out of the cupboard which meant they appeared within seconds and promptly started exclaiming how much they wanted the wet stuff while weaving in between the legs in an attempt to get me to give them the food as fast as possible.  We all know how difficult it can be to dodge cats weaving around underfoot  while digging through drawers and cupboards searching for the can opener.<br /><br />Amusingly, the label lists the product as being gluten free.  Not something I expected to see on the label.<br /><br />Overall we're pleased.  I'm not offended by the way the product looks or smells  and the cats love it.  My only complaint is that it is rather pricey compared to other options.<br /><br />Update Feb 17, 2009:<br />Well, after trying this I started sampling some other upscale cat foods.  I also started reading the ingredients.  I had no idea that wheat gluten was such a common ingredient.  Now that makes sense.<br /><br />As for price, it is close to the price range for other upscale / premium / gourmet (whatever you want to call the  small expensive cans) cat foods. Without subscribe & save the pricing is a bit higher here compared to what the other premium foods go for in the local stores.  With subscribe & save there isn't as much difference.<br /><br />I didn't think I would want to spend this much on cat food yet I just ordered some more.  To me there is significant value in that it doesn't have that 'canned cat food' smell.  You know what I'm talking about, and it really isn't a great way to wake up in the morning.  It also helps that Petite Cuisine is more visually appealing than the other stuff.<br /><br />The menadione thing?  From what I can find that may be valid.  Most of the stuff online references (and quotes) one article but the material safety sheet does have notes about toxicity of the substance to human organs at high doses.  It is in other pet foods as well, not just Petite Cuisine, so if you're concerned about it you need to read the label of any product.<br /><br />I did contact the company asking about it and stated that I was concerned about its use in their product.  If enough people contact them about it explaining their concern they may rethink using it as an ingredient.  For me, I'll probably use it in rotation with other foods.  Hopefully I can find something that doesn't stink and doesn't have any potentially objectionable ingredients."

The 3rd cat, notoriously picky, will only eat the yellowfin flavor.  He doesn't seem to like foods with whole chunks in them, but he is very fond of thinner foods with gravy.  There is less gravy in these cans than you find in ""regular"" store bought food, which means you get more actual food.  Good for us, but not so good for my picky cat who wants nothing but gravy!<br /><br />It's somewhat comforting to see recognizable bits of food in the cans.  The shrimp in the tuna & shrimp flavor especially is neat - they're whole salad shrimp.  Also, the food sits well with them.  The price isn't much more than what you'd pay for good food at a pet shop.  All in all I would recommend trying this."
20420,B001BDDTB2,A1ZM846Y7AUYD,M. Pickering,3,3,4,1228176000,Healthy Feline Cuisine For Your Finicky Cat(s),"Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called ""potentially harmful"" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim ""Natural"" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that ""Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.""  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says ""Product of Thailand"", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is ""people food for cats.""  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal."

Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."
20422,B001BDDTB2,ABLKO3TSRPKPP,Kristina Thompson,3,3,5,1227571200,Good enough to eat--literally!,"I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay."

If I ate meat, I'd have a hard time telling the difference between this and actual human food if both were set before me for dining pleasures.  The food doesn't have that nasty characteristic cat food smell.  I don't know if I can attribute it to this food, but my cat's breath doesn't stink (I've had several cats in my life, and smelly breath was generally a constant).  My only complaint about this food is that all of my local grocers and pet stores don't stock it.  I wish it was more readily available in my town.  Also, I wish the ingredients were sourced in the good ole US of A.  Aside from these points, it's a fantastic cat food and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality food for their special buddy."

20428,B001BDDTB2,AP6ZL52YA27W5,Chambolle,2,2,3,1240617600,Cats love it -- but I am concerned,"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again."

But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.

My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater."
20436,B001BDDTB2,A1BK60GZ4QME6I,John W. Graham,2,2,3,1228089600,One out of three cats partially liked it,"I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box."
20437,B001BDDTB2,A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,JC Chupack,2,2,5,1228089600,Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict,"My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys.  It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup."
20438,B001BDDTB2,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""",2,2,5,1228089600,My 12 cats like this product just fine (details),"With 12 cats (1 outdoor, 2 part-time outdoor, 9 full-time indoor), it didn't take me long to test this product! The first day, I introduced the cats to the Petite Cuisine seafood entr&eacute;es. The next evening, they got to try these two Entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />What do you get in this package?<br /><br />SIX FOUR-PACKS of cat food. Each serving comes in a small tin, (3 ounces each), 24 tins all total. EACH four-pack includes:<br /><br />-- two Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;es<br />-- two Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;es<br /><br />As I said, each tin is a breakfast or supper-sized serving for your cat. These are the smaller-type tins, not the larger Friskies-sized ones (from which I get two servings).<br /><br />I gave each of my cats a tin of this (I included half of one flavor, and half of the other) and just let them go to whichever bowl that they wished, which is how I always feed them (They normally get Science Diet hard food twice daily and then canned catfood once every two days for a special treat). They went after the ""gravy"" first and, after licking that all up, they ate the solid food. All the cats ate all the food. These cats are all orphans (former strays) and some were really ferrel when we first took them in -- now they're all spoiled and calm. Most are pretty old (seven of them are over 10 years old). One cat is especially finicky about her food but she ate this product just fine.<br /><br />This catfood (like most catfood) is sort of nasty looking when you open a tin but that's because all the good chunks of chicken meat have settled to the bottom. The fairly clear gravy has some thickness, not watery. I was pretty enthused when I saw the tiny carrot pieces in the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e. I was initially afraid that they would eat around the carrots but they didn't -- they gulped it right down with the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />I'll give you the ingredients list here from the Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e: Chicken, chicken broth, sweet potato, carrots, soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, calcium sulfate, Olive oil, vitamins and minerals (Vitamin E supplement, Vitamin A supplement, Vitamin D3 supplement), zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfate complex (source of Vitamin K activity), Riboflavin supplement, folic acid, Pryidoxine hydrochloride, copper amino acid complex, iron amino acid complex, Carrageenan, Choline Chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Guarantee analysis: crude protein (min) 12%, crude fat (min) 1%, crude fiber (max) 1%, moisture (max) 85%, ash (max) 3%. This catfood contains no Wheat Gluten.<br /><br />The breakdown on both flavors runs about the same. Two of my cats are diabetic (they each get two insulin injections per day) which means, in the real world, that they throw up quite often. This food did not make them throw up.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this catfood with these two caveats:<br /><br />-- it's pricey.<br />-- they still like one type of Friskies brand slightly better (they fight over it): Salmon Dinner.<br /><br />Given those two items, this catfood is a winner. Highly recommended."

Next few ingredients are also good, but this is not ""natural"" cat food and thus, includes preservatives and taste enhancers (that I generally avoid). Also, the packaging is cute, but excessive. You get a case of 24 cans, but within that case, are 6 smaller boxes that hold 4 cans each. None-the-less, the quality is superior to ""fancy feast"" or other bottom-rung cat foods. This food is a solid ""medium quality"". The food is what I call ""gravy"" style as opposed to ""loaf"" style, meaning you are paying for a decent amount of gravy in each can as opposed to meat and other real food. To their credit though, the chicken is REAL white meat chicken, not processed chicken parts made to look like ""shredded chicken"". The cats love it and the packaging (though excessive) makes it convenient for storing little cans in your cupboard."

One cat is a ""people food"" lover; he will eat almost anything that we eat (turkey is his favorite).  The first time we introduced this food to him, he lapped it up.  The other cat does not touch ""people food"" at all.  He took one sniff of this food and turned on his heels.  We tried all flavors and he wouldn't eat any of them.<br /><br />So, if you have a cat who loves ""people food"", Petite Cuisine will probably satisfy him.  This cat food is of high quality with no ""by-products"" and comes in single serving pop-top cans.  Highly recommended for cats that are open to new flavors but may not be for those that prefer to stick with what they know."

We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store."

When I opened the first can of Petite Cuisine, he thought he'd died and went to heaven. This was bits of chicken breast, broth and a few very finely chopped vegetables. The chicken pot pie had a more watery broth - the sesame chicken was in a more gravy-like sauce - but both flavors were devoured.<br /><br />My cats are big, outdoorsy cats. They were all once feral. They still frequently bring home a snake, vole or squirrel for entertainment - or supper. I have six: 4 big guys (14-17 pounds) and two slightly smaller girls (11 and 12 pounds).) They appreciate fancy little tidbits of food on a saucer. They especially liked Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />They have free access throughout the day to dry kibble: Purina One Chicken&Rice and Purina Indoor  mixed half and half. We have 3 small <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DI30O"">Petmate Le Bistro Feeders</a> which they love.

They liked the Petite Cuisine better than Fancy Feast or Purina Selects.<br /><br />This package contains 24 cans. 12 cans are pot pie - 12 sesame. The price is comparable to Purina Selects, Fancy Feast or Sheba from the grocery store - but I think the quality is higher. This looks and smells like chicken my Moma cooks! At the end of one week of feeding Petite Cuisine, all of six of them - their fur just glistened.<br /><br />Nigel is plotting: How to work computer and get Petite Cuisine on auto-subscribe shipment from Amazon?

20461,B001BDDTB2,A2K3DB7X56UXLZ,JC Chupack,1,1,5,1229904000,Pleasing for the cat and for me - a good alternative for my Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys addict,"My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys. It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens! When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him. After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food. First, I want it to have real ingredients listed. I don't like for it to have by-products. (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food) Second, I don't want it to stink. If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it. Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria. Next was the big question: would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off. He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting. Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior. He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day. I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn. It really looks like people food. He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth. This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off. He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest. Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken. It smelled pleasantly like Asian food. His reaction was to sniff and wander off. After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food. So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor. I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM. It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day. A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior. He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits. I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily. Clearly, my kitty has preferences. I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)) that are available on Amazon. He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past. It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand. I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance. That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general. The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup."

Their tagline is ""People food for cats"" and they are quite right. They smell and look delicious.<br /><br />There are basically two types of canned cat food in my experience, the first kind is the solid kind where you tip the can into the plate and the food retains the shape of the can. The second type is the  more liquidy type that you can spoon, almost pour into the cats plate. For me this second type is preferable because it has a higher content of liquid which I consider to be healthier for the cats urinary system. This cat food is of this second type.<br /><br />My cat is a very finicky eater and he takes time to adjust to new foods.<br />This package contains two flavors; the first is chicken pot pie which looks just like real chicken pot pie, right down to the light gravy, there are cubes of real chicken breast and it really looks like pot pie. My cat laps up all the sauce then moves on to the chunks of chicken.<br /><br />Second flavor is sesame chicken: This smells really good and the chicken is not chunked but in thin strips. My cat loves the sauce and will drain it all dry but is not too fond of the chicken. He will probably adjust to it over time. This is why only four stars."

Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better."

The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.

My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of ""menadione sodium sulfite in pet food"" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page."

I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this ""at home"" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!!

The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back."

There is actually quite a bit of broth, which concerned me when I opened the first can because I thought the can was mostly water.  However, it's real broth and evidently pretty tasty, because my cats practically inhale it -- they love it!  Once they finish the broth, they start working on the chicken and always clear the whole plate.  I'll definitely buy more of this."

The Sesame Chicken is a bit more solid.<br /><br />Whatever the consistency, my cat gave this product high stars, if licking up every morsel and drop is any indication. And I have to admit it smells pretty darn good, not like a lot of cat foods. (Of course, funky smells have never bothered my cat -- the more odorous the better, in her opinion). The daily serving size suggestions are a bit too generous:  1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight. That means 3 to 6 cans for an 8-pound cat, and if you've got a healthy 10-pounder, that means 4 to 8 cans a day? No way.<br /><br />I don't think we'll be using this as a daily food, but rather as an occasional change of pace. It's certainly palatable, but the messiness is a negative.

Most lattes are too sweet and not spicy enough for me. This tea is far and away the most spicy, full of a rich flavors of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom, and yet, it has a very sweet note as well, probably because of the carob. The oolong tea leaves allow you to steep it long enough to get a strongly spiced flavor without the tea tannins going bitter. I don't even blend it into milk or add sugar -- I think a strongly brewed cup is perfect as it is. It's great to travel with if you have a strainer mug or brew it before you go, because even as it cools off it continues to taste spicy yet sweet. I much prefer it to Teavana's other chai blends, and over any other chai I've had really. While pricey, I find 2 oz. lasts about two weeks if you drink one large 12oz tumblr of tea a day, and longer if you're drinking an 8oz mug. The used leaves don't rebrew particularly well and take on a kind of ""metallic"" taste if you boil the leaves to try and improve the weak flavor of the rebrew, but this seems a small criticism of an otherwise excellent and robust tea."

Osterhout ""Cindy O""",0,0,5,1310083200,What a Deal,"About a month ago, I found a deal on Amazon by which I was able to order two, three lb. bags of this flavor of Fancy Feast and so I set the three lb bags up to come to my house every three months. Then, I was cruising through the Fancy Feast aisles looking for some wet food with cheese in it by Fancy Feast when I happened across these bags. After I read up on these, I decided to cancel the other order and put this in to be delivered at 6 month intervals with Subscribe and Save.<br />I will be getting more food at one time than I was previously BUT there are some real positives to it for me.<br />Number one: I like getting my wet and dry cat food delivered to my home. It saves me from tromping off to PetCo so often. When I go to PetCo, I am like a kid in a candy store. They have SO MUCH stuff. I tend to get carried away and buy things I don't need. Now I will be going only once or twice a year to get foods that my kitties cannot get from Amazon. That I can handle.<br />Number 2: Since these are packaged in 16 ounce packages, I can just rip one open and put in in my Kibble bowl which holds 48 ounces. It takes my kitties quite a while to eat their way through that. Now, I do not have to store open cat food in my closet. With the larger packages, I was doing that. I would mix the flavors to keep the kitties happy with a variety of tastes, but as a consequence had 3 open bags of cat food in my closet. That meant that the kibble got spilled on the floor and I was forever having to pick it up. With these packages, I can still mix the 3 flavors, but will not have kibble dripping in my closet as a result.<br />Number 3: the kibble will stay fresher. In addition to still providing the kitties with a variety of tastes, I will now always have fresh tastes for them. Lord knows how stale that stuff gets after it sits in a 7 pound bag which is open, for a while. Now the spoiled mousers will always have fresh food which is carried to the door by someone else.<br />Number 4: Kitties stay healthy. The primary staple of my kitties diet is Fancy Feast Kibble. They each get a can of wet food each evening as a supplement. I do this to increase the fluid intake of the male to keep his urinary tract in good shape. I just had the cats to the vet and he said they are in great health and to keep doing whatever I am doing. So, Fancy Feast Kibble it is.<br />Number 5: The Ferals like it too. I have one or two feral cats who come to my door each night for their supper. The basic ingredient is Fancy Feast. Needless to say, they continue to show up night after night, so I gather it pleases their palate also.<br />So all kitties are happy and healthy here. I am really thrilled with this item and will use it as long as it is available."

I'm glad I ordered this six pack though so I didn't make the mistake of buying a three-pack of one of the flavors I didn't like. Here's what I thought of them:<br /><br />Vanilla - EXCELLENT! I've used this syrup in ice cream, coffee, diet cola, and even in a low-carb crepe recipe. It's really good and one that I will re-order on it's own.<br /><br />Hazelnut - Yummy, rich flavor. It's great in coffee. I would order this again.<br /><br />Raspberry - I loved this one also. It's great in coffee and berry smoothies.<br /><br />Chocolate - I liked this one but it is VERY STRONG. Literally, one drop in a glass of diet cola will make it into a chocolate coke. It's good, but you don't need much. It didn't work well in coffee.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I knew I wouldn't like this one so it remains unopened. I made a mistake of buying a three pack of this one once and hated it. I'll give it away to someone who will enjoy it.<br /><br />CLASSIC Caramel - I don't know why Torani insists on making ""Sugar Free Caramel Syrup"" and ""Sugar Free CLASSIC Caramel Syrup"". The Classic Caramel is terrible. After experimenting and trying to find a use for this syrup I just dumped it down the drain. It's not worth it. Avoid this one."

I couldn't believe that they had it on the sugar-free variety pack! So 6 bottles for less than 2 bottles, with my Amazon Prime ... was a deal I couldn't resist.<br /><br />My favorites are the Raspberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate, although I also enjoy the other three flavors.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the Torani syrups, they are an excellent addition to your coffee, your frappes, your oatmeal, your hot chocolate:  almost anything you sweeten, you can add a little Torani flavor. And unlike the creamy texture of other liquid chocolates, these are ""clear.""  In fact, if you ask for a squirt of flavor at your local coffee shop, most likely you will receive it from one of the Torani bottles!<br /><br />This summer I bought the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G"">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a> and started making Ice Blended coffee at home. While I love using the flavored coffees, it is difficult to find my favorites locally in a decaf blend. It is also impossible to find most of the Torani sugar-free flavors locally, which I need as a diabetic. So throw some of this in with my regular decaf, and WOW!!! I'm in love.<br /><br />Note - The one kind available in my local grocery store is a 12-oz bottle for $5, comparing to  than $10 for each of these bottles. Do be cautious if you are buying the single bottles on Amazon - which run much higher than that. However, this variety pack works out to a fantastic price.<br /><br />Great Taste - Great Price - Great Product.

When I saw these, I thought I would never go through all of them, I'm now ordering my second set.  I even ordered the pumps, which makes it super easy to measure how much you are adding, one pump or two.  Normal flavor 2 pumps, chocolate often just 1 (it is strong), extra flavor or large cup might be 3.<br /><br />I mainly use these in coffee.  I've found flavored coffee just doesn't taste as good.  I talked to a friend who owns a coffee store and he said none of the coffee stores will use the flavored coffee because you just don't get a lot of the flavor, that is why they all use the syrups, more variety and better flavor.<br /><br />My main suggestion is to not be afraid of mixing the flavors, again a trick I saw in the coffee shops.  I found mixing the caramel and chocolate in my coffee with milk is as close to a starbucks latte that I can get.  I didn't like the raspberry much until I added a tiny bit of chocolate.  Wow chocolate covered raspberries!  This is great on vanilla ice Cream too.  So if you find you don't like one of the flavors, try adding a bit of another."

20502,B003PFUNU4,A1XOC2GL2EIM0F,M. Cohen,6,6,4,1291680000,Good variety,"I ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PFWNSE"">Torani Variety Pack, Regular, 25.36-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>.  I had never tried Torani products before and I had wanted to try them as I heard good things about their sugar free syrups.  I have tried 4 of the flavors that I thought I would like.  They are so good that I have trouble believing that they are SUGAR FREE and FAT FREE!<br /><br />My two favorite flavors are Vanilla and Hazelnut. I stopped using fattening products in my coffee and stopped buying lattes and cappuccinos because they are so fattening.  However, my coffees were now so ordinary that I practically stopped drinking coffee.  Torani syrups changed all that! Both the Torani Vanilla and Torani Hazelnut are so incredibly good tasting, that they turn my so-so coffee into a lattee-like drink.  Wow!  It is hard to believe these syrups are sugar free and low in calories! The Torani Chocolate appears to be an equally good product although I was disappointed when it did not enhance my coffee.  Torani Chocolate is very strong which means that you should add less than you do with the Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors.  For Vanilla and Hazelnut, I add about 1/2 to 1 oz of syrup to a very large (12 oz) coffee.  Putting the same amount of Chocolate in coffee did not enhance the flavor.  In other types of shakes, I will probably use less than the usual amount of Chocolate.  I think it might be better in milk shakes.  Since I love Chocolate as a flavor, I should be able to find good uses for it.  I also love the Raspberry flavor in iced tea and it adds an interesting twist to lemonade.  I think Raspberry will be good with other fruity flavors.  Although I am disappointed in a few of the flavor bottles that came with this 6 pack, I am basically happy with the purchase.  The bottles that are good are REALLY GOOD!  Additionally, purchasing all 6 varieties gave me the chance to try a number of different Torani SF syrups that are yummy and let me know which to choose and which to avoid. I probably will not like either the Irish Creme or Classic Caramel flavors because I am not partial to these flavors by any beverage maker.  I will probably not open them and give these flavors away to someone who will appreciate them more than me."

Ritchey,8,9,3,1299801600,I've Had Better but Not in Sugar-Free,"My local grocery store only carries the vanilla Torani syrup in the sugar-free version, and so I decided to order the variety pack from Amazon to see what I thought of their other flavors.  I try to limit my sugar intake, so that's why I was so keen to get a variety of sugar-free ones.  Interestingly, I found that the different flavors do better in different types of drinks.<br /><br />Vanilla - This is still hands down one of the most versatile flavors. I add it to carbonated water and make my own creme soda. It also does well in hot chocolate and coffee, and I've also added it to baking recipes when I've been in a pinch and out of vanilla extract.<br /><br />Raspberry - I'm not usually a huge fan of artificial raspberry flavors, and I don't like this one in coffee or hot chocolate, but it is absolutely wonderful in iced tea! Who knew? I was prepared to donate this one to the office coffee stash, but on a whim added it to my iced tea when I was out of Splenda, and wow, it's very good and seems to lose the funky aftertaste in the tea.<br /><br />Caramel - I'm not overly impressed with this one, but it does work well in adding to my oatmeal in the morning to liven up the plain oats. It tastes even better with a dash of cinnamon, but I don't use this one in drinks because it just tastes kind of odd. It's almost like they couldn't decide between caramel, butterscotch and some other random flavor and kind of went with the middle ground.  I wouldn't order this flavor by itself.<br /><br />Chocolate - This is another one that I've added to my oatmeal at breakfast and have been happy with the result.  This one also works with coffee, but not tea.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I'm a big Irish Creme fan usually, but this one is just kind of so-so.  I do like it in a glass of hot milk for a steamer, and it's okay in hot chocolate, but tastes weird in coffee.<br /><br />Hazelnut - This is a good one for coffee, hot chocolate and oatmeal.  I combine it with the Chocolate one in the oatmeal and it tastes kind of like a Ferrero Rocher, and makes my daily breakfast feel like a bit more of an indulgence than it really is.<br /><br />I ordered the Variety Pack on the Subscribe and Save 4 month rotation, and had to go in and cancel the second shipment because I'm only about halfway through the bottles. It's a toss up as to whether or not I'll completely cancel the subscription because these are sugar-free and it's so hard to find flavor additions that don't come laden down with teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Amazon - it would be wonderful if you could offer a make your own variety pack of the Sugar-free syrups! I've seen other Torani sugar-free choices, but I don't want to make the commitment to a 6 pack of a single flavor. I'd definitely order a lot more of these syrups if I could mix up the Variety pack to be more than just these 6 flavors."

But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.<br /><br />I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.<br /><br />My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.

It's not overly sweet as the originals may be but it's not bad and it's a great substitution!<br /><br />I'll update my feedback once I've opened a few more which should be a while. I'm also hoping I like all of them enough to make a repurchase in several months when these are gone.  I went to the Torani website and found tons of recipes so I'm hoping I can make something delicious!  I'm glad I didn't place myself on the auto ship because I don't think that I'll go through them fast enough but I will definitely be considering a repurchase!<br /><br />Does anyone know the nutritional info on the full-sugar ones?  I'd be interested to know!"

I also wish they'd come in glass as opposed to plastic bottles in these sizes maybe even flip tops because then they could have been recycled and used for wine or beer bottling purposes which would be great. As for the flavor I've tried 3 out of the 6 so far raspberry, chocolate, and caramel. The caramel has a nice aroma to me and tastes all right, but my least favorite so far. The chocolate seems to mix really nice with the raspberry and also seems to really stand out better to me in iced coffee. The raspberry was my favorite out of the 3 I've had the opportunity to try thus far. I think they are nice additions to flavor coffee's with, but you need to figure out the right consistencies on the amounts to use with them too much tastes a bit artificial and too little and it can be too subtle and difficult to discern the flavoring in them. I'd give them 4 out 5 overall they seem decent really, but has areas for improvement though I wouldn't exactly hesitate to recommend them or give them away as a gift to the right person."

At the subscribe price, I got each of these really large bottles for about the same price I paid for a very small bottle at wally world, and they only carry a few sugar free flavors..<br /><br />We're on Atkins, so we've really cut down on carbs, but we both like sweets, so these syrups let us still have sweets without the carbs..<br /><br />The Hazlenut is not my favorite flavor, but I've used it in MiM's (muffin in a minute) and it tasted a lot better than I expected.. I know a lot of people use this flavor in coffee, but I don't personally like it in coffee. If you do, it'd be great for that.<br /><br />The Classic Caramel is delicious.. I've used it in MiM's, Italian sodas, protein shakes and in coffee.. I've also mixed it with the chocolate sugar free syrup and the two together make another delicious taste treat.. The two combined make the best Italian soda ever! I've made chocolate MiM's with cream cheese frosting flavored with this flavor.. Love the taste.<br /><br />I read some other feedback concerning the Classic Caramel, stating it isn't very good and to be sure to purchase the tradition Caramel.. I've never tasted the traditional, but have to say, I think the Classic is delicious.. Taste's like a piece of caramel candy to me.<br /><br />The Chocolate is delicious. Works good in MiM's, italian soda's, coffee, cream cheese frostings, protein shakes, anything you want to add chocolate to without the carbs..<br /><br />The Raspberry tastes exactly like raspberry's.. It's great.. We use it on home made yogurt with raspberry's on top.. pour a little syrup over it, and it's a delicious, low carb treat..Also great in a low carb protein shake mixed with raspberry's and a little syrup, mix in a blender and it's like a shake.. Delicious! I also used it in MiM's, or as cream cheese frosting on a chocolate MiM...YUMMY...Mixed it with chocolate in an italian soda.. Delicious..<br /><br />The Irish Cream is delicious used in a MiM in both the muffin and mixed in softened cream cheese to frost it.. Also fantastic in Italian soda's.. Haven't tried it in a protein shake yet, but imagine it'll be great. Probably great in yogurt, too.. Very tasty!<br /><br />I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but have to say, the vanilla is really good! Can be used in all kinds of things calling for vanilla, but really good when mixed with the chocolate in an italian soda or mixed in softened cream cheese to frost a chocolate MiM...<br /><br />All in all, great variety of syrups.. The one I would change is the Hazlenut.. I've just never been a big Hazlenut fan, but I'm sure I'll find more uses for it eventually."

20536,B003PFUNU4,A21C5CR95LT0ZY,S. Jackson,0,0,3,1335916800,Great for new users; disappointing for those with an established favorite.,"I can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugar-free products. Many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to. But I gave these a shot because I'm not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That's an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.<br /><br />So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.<br /><br />My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.<br /><br />In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.<br /><br />Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full-bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you're craving that touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my ""To-Try List"".<br /><br />Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry-pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn't work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar-free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.<br /><br />It's hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.<br /><br />Overall though I say this sampler is great if you're new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I'd suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail-reduced price of under $5 a bottle."

I had hopes that the flavored syrup would at least hide the bad taste but to me it only seems to make it worse. I will buy the Torani Flavored syrups again but only in the sugar sweetened versions.The true flavors of these Sugar Free syrups seems to be overpowered by the Slenda after taste.

Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you.  It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it.  I'm disappointed in Heinz about his.  Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially).<br /><br />I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:<br />""INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP""<br /><br />Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful."

Unlike green tea which will stay good in the little bags seemingly for years, a lot of herbal teas turn sour or dusty in no time. So if the merchant has had them on the shelf for a while what you are actually buying is flavorless dust. This mixture is always very fresh tasting and super delicious. I add it to green tea all the time. Recently when my brother-in-law visited us he tasted my green tea with this mixture and raved saying: ""This is like a meal!"" It is so rich and upfront with this mixture that it is really complex and so tasty. The herbs relax you a bit, which if mixed with green tea and its caffeine is sort of robbing Peter to pay Paul in terms of energy. I drink it in the morning all the time, and it has never made me sleepy. I recommend it on the basis of taste, I sort of doubt it would work to induce sleep.

We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food."
20614,B0018CJYPG,A9TFKOQ57V1QB,Resa,11,11,5,1285113600,"Good quality, affordable food.","It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)"

One of the local pet stores recommended it for our golden retriever because of the skin problems that he was experiencing. His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!"

It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer."

She had allergies and mange and her immume system was very compromised.  I put her on this food and it cleared her skin up in less than a month!  I've researched a lot of food online and at the Pet stores and this I believe is the best!  It is a tad pricey but if you love your dog like I do then it's worth it.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry this for a very long time.

Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.

We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier."

Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges."

Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.,"We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012)."

Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.

Friend,1,1,4,1326153600,"Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg","I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)"

I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me).

While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called ""premium"" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  ""Lamb meal"" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat."

They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had ""doggy breath."" I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath ""fresh"" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China.

I used it as a hot chocolate for my kids by leaving out the espresso disc and only using the chocolate peppermint one included in this package and a milk disc from a different package I had.

To mask the odor, I began using it mixed with some Earl Grey from Stash.  This worked well and I really enjoy the mix.  However, when I found that Davidson had a Rooibos with a Chai mix, I decided to try that.  I found I liked it very much and didn't notice any unusual odor.<br />Others have commented on the tea being very finely ground and that is true.  I make a lot of ice tea using a West Bend 68303 machine.  It has a very fine screen that should handle Rooibos very well.  However, coffee filters are cheap.  I put in a coffee filter in the tea holder before filling it with tea and that works very well.  Also, it's a snap to clean later for you just dump the filter and grounds all at once.<br />I'm not very good at describing the taste.  I drink about 2 quarts a day of ice tea and can only say I really love the flavor of Masala Chai Rooibos.  I also love Davidson's packaging.  I find myself using this tea every day.  Sometimes I mix a bag or two of something else with it, but it is always the foundation of whatever I brew.  I also sometimes add a flavored sweetener like vanilla or caramel.  All in all this is an excellent and economical tea.  I recommend it highly."

My final verdict is that these shots are smooth enough to make milk-based drinks that need little-to no sweetener, as the shots (done properly) have very little or no bitterness.

A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.<br /><br />When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.<br /><br />The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.<br /><br />The overall verdict is meh.

""Rich Tea"" are also the ultimate dunking biscuits, for which purposes they must, of course, be entirely whole and not cracked even in the slightest, otherwise they will instantly fall in half and disappear to the bottom of the cup. Even whole, these biscuits present the maximum challenge to the dunker -- leave the biscuit in the tea just a fraction of a second too long and, again, you'll wonder where your biscuit went (and why you have blotting paper at the bottom of your cup).  [American readers please note that dunking is, of course, entirely frowned upon in English high society, as an activity undertaken only by the peasant classes. It is thus to be indulged in only when entirely alone and in the privacy of one's own home, when there is no danger of being observed by the servants.]<br /><br />Should your biscuits arrive broken, as may, unfortunately, be all too likely (as these are a fragile biscuit and McVitie's packaging consists of no more than a paper wrapper) do not despair; all is not lost.

On weekends, there was live jazz. Good food. But it was the chicken wings that made visits there special. Once, several of us scored tickets for a Buffalo Sabres' hockey match at the Aud. Before going there, we had dinner at the Anchor Bar. Unhappily, the first one to order requested hot wings. Filled with testosterone, the rest of us simply had to go along. Result? Lots of sweat, a deep burning sensation, red faces. . . . It was a fine adventure--but not necessarily enjoyable! Man, it was raw fire! The medium wings there bring heat--but at a tolerable level.<br /><br />This product represents the Anchor Bar's own recipe. But it is pretty clear to me that it is tamped down a bit, and not as spicy as the actual ""medium"" wings that you would get if you ate at the Anchor Bar itself. My son and I just tried this wing sauce and ended up adding some Texas hot sauce to ramp up the heat. Perhaps the ""hot"" version that one can purchase also would be more like the ""real"" medium sauce at the Bar. That will be our next experiment.<br /><br />Still and all, this is a tasty sauce for chicken wings and I would be happy to recommend it for others. It tastes better than the sauce I made just a couple weeks ago, before I discovered that one could buy it online. However, if you want the fire, maybe have a little Texas hot sauce to spice it up a bit."

I believe it's packaged by the same company that makes ""PG-Tips"" in the handy pyramid bags.  The quality is comparable.  I generally buy the brooke bond loose for making everyday tea by the pot, and I buy pg tips pyramid bags for travelling.<br /><br />Anyway, I buy the Brooke Bond loose on a regular basis - either online, or at a local indo-pakistani grocer.  I've also bought the Taj Mahal label by the same company, but they appear to be interchangeable, and differ only by the art on the box.  The loose tea is in small granule form, and comes sealed in a foil pouch, for freshness ... it's not flushed with neutral gas, and they dont vaccum pack it because they dont want to crush the tea, but otherwise the quality is pretty decent.  It comes in a variety of sizes, buy the most common size I buy is 900 grams (2 lbs) or 1800 gr (4lbs).<br /><br />The resulting tea is not quite as floral as some assams I've had (hey, it's bulk tea), and there's often a modest amount of tea dust in the bottom of the pouch, but the dust is easily removed by pouring the dry tea into a fine strainer, and tapping the strainer over the garbage (to winnow it), before brewing it.<br /><br />In my household, I generally buy loose tea in bulk, de-dust it, then repackage it in one or more 40 fl oz glass jars using a univeral vaccum sealing lid (see Tilia Food Saver), and then I use those to periodically refill a smaller 16-24 oz convenience container that I keep near my stove, for whenever I want to brew a fresh pot of tea.<br /><br />I've found that 1/4 cup of loose tea is sufficient for a 6 cup pot, and 1/4 - 1/3 cup is sufficient for 8 cups.  After brewing is done (3-5 mins), I pour the brewed tea through a fine tea strainer into serving cups, and the surplus goes into a lidded glass carafe that gets stored in the fridge (after it cools) for subsequent reheating by the cup (re: microwave), or for use in iced tea by the jug (just add some simple syrup and fresh lemon juice to taste, and some optional bruised mint leaves, and you're good to go).<br /><br />Bottom line - for an inexpensive loose bulk tea, this brand is very decent all purpose choice, suitable for both hot and iced tea.  Recommended."

I bought these for her about two months ago when I started to be a little bothered by her breath (she's a kisser). I bought them from amazon because they were so much cheaper then at the local pet store.<br />At first, she had no interest in them. I was a little annoyed, having bought a box of 96 that was still expensive for dog treats even with the discount. She either would ignore it no matter how many times I tried reintroducing it, or take a bite then leave it. It took a few weeks and several tries, but now she loves them and eats them as soon as I give it to her. I give her at most one a day but usually one every two or three days. It hasn't upset her stomach or anything like that. The package says they aren't suitable for dogs under 6 months of age, but I stared giving them to her at about 4 months and there were no problems. She has clean, healthy teeth, but I don't think she wouldn't if I stopped giving her these. They do work in freshening her breath, however. We have a 3 year old golden retriever in the house who eats these sometimes too and has loved them since the day they came- I guess it just depends on the dog. Even though they're not the correct size for him, he's never choked and I don't think it's a problem to buy the smaller size for a larger dog.

I would like to know where ""E.

If your dogs are gulpers or greedy chewers, then I wouldn't feed them ANYTHING, especially RAWHIDE, that could be gulped and swallowed in large pieces or whole.

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites.

She LOVES them and they definitely do the job.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about them is that they are sturdy and coated enough that I can freeze them--I put one in a small plastic bag (snack bag folded in half) full of water and freeze it for a few hours. Then my dog has to lick and crunch up the ice to get to the treat, which keeps her busy AND gets her more fluids. Most dog treats tend to dissolve and become mushy when you do this with them, but these guys definitely hold up."

We were given a couple of the Large ones from a friend to try.  Through carelessness on our part, our dog destroyed both large treats within 15 minutes.  When we found her, we were scared figuring she would die from swallowing this large plasticky looking treat.  We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).  We have tried many different treats & toys, but have NEVER had the type of response that we get from giving her a Greenie.  It seriously is like crack for dogs..."

I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product."

I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.

I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the ""risk"" with Greenies.

This vet was so excited, and YES i said EXCITED, to see my fur baby's gums and teeth. The vet asked to take a picture of Foxy's(my fur baby) teeth to post on their website. She asked me if i brush them daily. I said nope, we've been using greenies does that count?? She said YES and added, in detail, how healthy it is for them in A LOT of aspects. Buying them from a pet store is ridiculous to me because the price for a pack of 20 is over $19. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?! So when i saw this price and the amt that come in the pack, I've been buying them on here ever since!! I give them to her once a day EVERYDAY at 9pm. She even recognizes the word ""greenies"" and follows me to the pantry when it's that time of day for her.

A year later, during her annual dental cleaning she had 6 more teeth removed and is now down to about 8 total.  Shortly after I discovered Greenies.  Everyday I come home from work and after she is done going outside, she sits by the pantry door waiting for her Greenie.  When I open the door to the pantry she starts ""dancing"" on her two back legs.

The only negative aspect is that they get sticky & leave a green film that dries to a green crust on their front legs & paws (& whatever they're laying on, usually the sofa!)  Long after the bone has been chewed to a little nub & swallowed, my beautiful girls are licking their paws & staring at me, begging for another with their big, sad eyes.  Even though my puppies are only 12 lbs & just under 8 months old, I give them the regular size.  The smaller ones just don't last long enough with my power chewers.  I usually try to wrestle the small end from my girls before they get swallowed, as I do with EVERY treat they get, but I'm rarely successful.  They have the habit of swallowing pieces that seem far too large for them, but I've never had a problem with these bones.  I've never had any pieces reappear later (in any form) or had any blockage or choking problems.  I'm fully convinced that the bones dissolve quickly & safely in their tummies.<br />A lot of people have negative things to say about these treats, even our vet has a note about these specific bones causing ""digestive upset"" on his website, but I have had nothing but wonderful experiences (since purchasing washable slipcovers for our furniture!)<br />If you're worried about trying these treats, I'd suggest giving a larger size than is called for & observing your fur-child like any good parent should.<br /><br />Common sense for all pet owners:  Take the end of any treat away before it can be swallowed.  If you haven't already, ask your vet to teach you the doggie heimlich maneuver & doggie CPR, just in case."

My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day.

I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.

Ever since the first time I gave her a Greenie, my dog has gone nuts for these things. On our last trip to the vet they examined her teeth because I expressed concern that her overbite was preventing the Greenies from as effective as they should be. She can't really chew properly with the front teeth.<br /><br />This vet wasn't our usual vet because we went on a different day, but he looked at her teeth and asked how old she was. I said, ""Almost three."" And he asked if I'd had her in to have her teeth cleaned before. ""No, I didn't know dogs could have their teeth cleaned.""<br /><br />He went on to say that on a scale of one to four, one being the best and four being the worst, her teeth were a perfect one, which was surprising because Chihuahuas have teeth problems early on usually. I explained that I'd been using the Greenies since she was nine months old.<br /><br />I give her one Greenie every morning because they are so cheap on Amazon. In the store I pay twenty five dollars for a bag of twenty. I pay twenty two dollars on Amazon for a box of ninety six! It's easy to give her one daily. She is still marginally underweight, so I can't say they make her gain weight. She has no digestive issues and doesn't seem to be suffering from having them.

I must have 15-20 bags of different treats that he turns his nose up at (Busy bones, busy rollhides, busy granola, biscuits, chicken jerky treats, etc.) Greenies are the ONLY thing I can give him that I know for a fact he will eat. In fact, Siberian Huskies rarely if ever bark, but if I even go near him while he's chewing on the greenie he'll starting barking at me.. and well trying to take it away is another story.

The smell is so-so...and her breath is at least 1/2 better than is was before.  The greenies are not hard - you can bend them.  Not that the dog notices, but they are in the cute shape of a toothbrush.  She (the dog) runs around the house and hides the treat, then finally gives in and gobbles it up.  She then sniffs all over the place - hoping there is a crumb left behind.  There must be some doggie drug in those things, that's how much she loves them.  So - long story short - your dog would be crazy to NOT love these treats!  Worth the price - and they come in a nice container with a plastic lid that you just pop off to take a treat out."

A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding.

The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

His vet told us that his joints were in need of attention so I took it upon myself to buy Greenies treats that support joint care for large dogs. I started with a small bag to see if he liked them which he did. He was in love with them. I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product.

We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them.

21626,B002BCD2GO,A1TQIPT2QBAS6Z,Ddanimal,13,18,1,1335830400,"Agave ""nectar"" is a scam","from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. Inulin is a fructose polymer and is not digestible. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to separate the inulin into fructose molecules, resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you."

You might also try a general internet search engine and do the same.<br /><br />If you are concerned about your health, may I suggest you do this research and get the facts about this man made, very high fructose syrup?  I believe it is better to have all the information available to weigh against the agave industry's partial truths.  One article even suggests that current agave syrup labeling does not conform to FDA requirements.<br /><br />The consensus of non-vested conscientious science is that agave syrup is another bad guy.

I use the Agave in hot tea with creamer and for me it's a better flavor than using honey.  However, for coffee I prefer the strong honey flavor against the acid though I do not mind the Agave sweetener in coffee occasionally- it's still better than the flavor of plain sugar!  In foods such as oatmeal I will continue to use the 'light' Agave nector as it does not take much to get the oatmeal sweeter (whereas it does take a fair amount of honey). Additionally, another reviewer mentioned the 'Amber' tasting good in oatmeal too. Although I have not tried Agave Nector in baked goods or desserts I'm sure it would perform well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot compare prices/brands of Agave Nector as this is my first time purchasing Agave Nector but it seems comparable to the price of honey.  Agave is it's own flavor and I have enjoyed switching between honey and Agave for coffee and tea; it's nice to have variety for variety's sake and I can see why some would prefer to continue purchasing Agave Nector as it is such a healthy sweetener. Since it takes less Agave liquid to sweeten things it's a good buy since one would have to add more honey to get things sweet enough.<br /><br />I gave Agave Nector a 5 because I can see the creative potential in baking.  Adding the nector to whipped topping and/or adding to pancakes with fruit might be good--- an application you could not have attempted with honey alone!"

Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.

Despite the few negative reviews I had seen, and the low expectations that ensued, I found myself pretty pleasantly surprised when I received this gift basket earlier today.<br /><br />The packaging itself is solid. You get a dark-chocolate colored basket with just enough plastic wrapping to keep everything in pristine shape without being a hassle to open. There were no signs of re-purposed Jello boxes -- only a dense amount of straw lining the bottom to serve as a cushion. I thought it was a very nice touch.<br /><br />Now for the part that actually matters: The candy. You get a pretty well organized assortment of chocolate-themed products, varying from chocolate covered peanuts and raisins, to peanut butter cups and and marshmallow cups, and yes, there's even a few pieces of individually-wrapped dark and milk chocolate for the diehard choco-holic. This variation is well balanced so your tastebuds don't feel tired of any one particular confection.<br /><br />Of course, a couple items featured in this basket probably do have their comparable counterparts in your local grocer.

The lack of appropriate nutritional information on this particular package was also irritating.)<br /><br />Update - Thursday, October 27, 2011:<br /><br />Opened the package marked ""Kenzi Confections, All Natural Chocolate Napolitans Dark, Product of Belgium"" and discovered that it actually covered a box labeled ""Nestle Raisinets"", which made it IMPOSSIBLE to know the appropriate nutritional information on this handful of candy.  These also had been melted and re-hardened just like the other candies which caused them to look just as funky.<br /><br />No Pun Intended but wrapping up my reviews - regarding the Kenzi Confections inside other boxes such as Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard and Kellog's Fruit Loops is off-putting.  Makes me question the viability of the Kenzi Confection Company and why they can't afford their own packaging.<br /><br />The Lindt Lindor Mint Chocolate Truffles could have been better if they had not been melted first.  The filling inside had oozed out during the melt which resulted in a messy unwrapping that was not fully anticipated.<br /><br />The last, large, box looks suspiciously like a Kenzi Confection product because of the way it is ""wrapped"" with a label stating:  ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolates"", a well-known quote from the film ""Forrest Gump"".  As of this writing, on October 30, 2011, I am about to open it to see what damage has been delivered.<br /><br />Update = Wednesday, November 30, 2011<br /><br />This evening, I received the official gift basket with a note that what I previously received was a prototype that should never have been released to the general public.  This official gift basket looks better than what I got about a month ago.  The chocolate covered peanuts are MUCH better this time around!  I'll still need to check the rest of the candies in the coming days.<br /><br />Update = Tuesday,December 6, 2011<br /><br />I've been sampling the new basket that I received and have been enjoying the chocolates this time around.  I have two more boxes left to taste, within the basket, and I'm looking forward to that.<br /><br />Update = Wednesday, December 7, 2011<br /><br />The final box I sampled was labeled:  ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolate"", like the line from the movie ""Forrest Gump"".  This box included candies such as salted(?!?) caramel, chocolate covered pretzel, chocolate covered graham cracker, chocolate marshmallow cups, chocolate peanut butter cups, and small biscuit/cookies with chocolate on the bottom.<br /><br />Others might like these.  The marshmallow cups didn't impress me much as I'm not into that kind of candy.  The salted caramel I didn't care for much either as I don't like the taste of salt to begin with."

After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.<br /><br />Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?<br /><br />One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.<br /><br />So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.<br /><br />The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.<br /><br />With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.<br /><br />This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give."

She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix."

The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left!

We tried several Kong type products and he was able to either get his food out too quickly or grew bored and never ate. This toy makes him really work for his food and because he can see the food through the tube it really keeps his interest. My only gripe is that the plastic tube could be more sturdy.

The rope didn't last that long, but we just took the rope out and use larger treats with it, and it's still a challenge for her.

The outgoing one LOVES banging this toy around the house for hours. The shy one won't go near it. the first day with this, I filled it up almost full with kibble so it dispensed more easily, but she still got frustrated trying to figure out how to use it. After a couple of days, she can empty 1/2 cup of kibble from the small one in an hour :) and will continue to play with it as long as it has food in it.... the larger the treat size, the harder it is to come out. A couple kibble falls out every minute or so; a treat the size of a Zuke's Mini Bakes will come out every 5 to 10 minutes. I put 1/2 cup kibble and 10 mini bakes inside to keep her occupied for an hour. Note: the more full the jug is, the faster the dispensing rate (good for unmotivated dogs). The smaller the jug, the more full it is when a given amount of food is placed in it, thus if my pug had a hard time with the small size, I would buy the x-small so she could get the food out more easily.

I came across this while searching for dog toys, and loved the idea that it is not only a toy, but a reward/education system.  After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall)."

She's not terribly food-motivated in general, but she adores this toy, and we've taken to giving her one of her 2 daily meals out of the 'food bomb.' She seems to love working to get all the food bits out of it, and when that's done she alternates between gnawing on the screw top end of the toy, chewing on the rubber bit, and whipping it around by the rope.<br /><br />That brings me to the only potential drawback of the food bomb--I am convinced one of these days she's going to give me a concussion if she loses her grip on the rope while she's flinging it about. But since she has those strong pit bull jaws, hopefully that won't be an issue... Sometimes I'm shocked she hasn't given *herself* a concussion with it, but her head is apparently made of concrete.<br /><br />(Oh--and it has withstood a year's worth of her efforts to destroy it so far, which is more than I can say for the vast majority of toys that enter the house.)"

Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog.

Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor."

Sometimes toys take a little warm up period.  So we grabbed it up, acted like it was great fun, teased him with the rope, tossed it, ran to get it, and did all the things that usually get our heeler into a playing frenzy.

The Tug-a-Jug is solidly constructed.  We've had ours for a month so far, and have used it nearly every day.  It is absolutely worth the twelve dollars it is currently selling for.<br /><br />The medium/large size hard plastic bottle is about the size of a large (32 oz) sports drink bottle.  As the dog tugs the rope and manipulates the bottle, bits of kibble - or whatever you want to put in it - come out.  You can also change the level of challenge by putting ping pong balls or other things in the bottle.<br /><br />Hobbes is a 60 lb Lab mix, and a cup of kibble will last him about fifteen minutes.  In a bowl, the same amount is gone in seconds.  It's a great way for him to have some mental stimulation and settle down in the evening before bed.  Because he loves it so much, it's a great training aid.  At a minimum, he sits politely to ask for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: (September 2, 2011) Hobbes chewed right through the rope a month or so ago. However, we removed the remnants of the rope and put in more ping pong balls to plug the hole. This way we haven't had to buy a new one and he still enjoys it every night."
21801,B000KV61FC,AAXQSP6DYEBEW,tf0588,1,1,5,1303603200,Favorite toy,"I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars."
21802,B000KV61FC,A2DNCSRWGV1QE1,jean Lovejoy,1,1,1,1303257600,Great while it lasted,My one year old Lab. loved the bottle filled with his kibble. The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end  ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them.  You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food.  The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces.  The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure.  Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it.

One is a male 13 yrs old sharpei/golden retriever mix, another is a female 4 yrs old black lab, and the other is a 1 yr old great pyrenees. All of them ignore it completely! They seem to like the kong with treats in it best or the buster cube or a toy similar. However my sister's dog is a mix of german shepard and she loves this toy. So it kind of depends on the dog. Some dogs love it, some dogs ignore it."

They love to tear and chew anything up!  This is a great toy as it is durable, but also keeps them busy for hours trying to remove the treats.  It is adorable watching them try to figure out the rope\treat technique.  I ended up buying another one so they didn't have to share.

I put her kibble in it and she immediately hauls it into her crate she she can get the food out without having to chase it around the house.  She is not a toy chewer, but this has cracked just from her dropping it a few inches.  I have glued it several times, but the last time was so bad that the glue has now made it so I can't screw the bottom on.  This has lasted 1 month with a very gently now 5 month old Newfoundland. Not a great track record, but she loves it so much that I will order another. Thank God for Amazon Prime where I can get another one quickly as she looks disappointed when I put her food in her dish rather than this device."

He drains it pretty quickly, but we fill it with kibble thats different than his standard so its not too many treats.  Its fun to watch him play with it as well, since you can see him focus and think about it.  I recommend this to someone with a puppy that loves to think and do things."
21807,B000KV61FC,A296L8EY2F5A7T,AMC,1,1,5,1300233600,Puppy Loves It!,"My large Labradoodle puppy loves this toy.  He quickly figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him busy for a few minutes so that he is not chewing things that he shouldn't be!  The only downside is that it makes a lot of noise on the floors; but that's OK since he is a happy boy with this toy."
21808,B000KV61FC,A2RZAIJD4SEV6Z,Anne,1,1,5,1299283200,Challenging and Durable,"I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for ""aggressive chewers"" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)"
21809,B000KV61FC,AQQH4FCN0UPZV,DC Cathnstella,1,1,4,1298505600,Great for smart busy dogs!,"I have a 2 year old border collie mix who gets bored easily and loves interactive toys. She gets so excited when I bring this toy out. However, she is a very strong chewer so she was able to chew through the rope within a day or so. I read on the Busy Buddy website a great suggestion: put a tennis ball in the bottle to make the toy useful again. This has worked well and makes the treats a challenge to get out. She figured it out very quickly but she is also a very smart and curious dog. My only complaint is that it is very loud on the wood floors! this toy is best if you have carpet or at least don't have a basement tenant in your house."

Dog does enjoy, carries it around wanting to play fetch but settles on tug a war. It does keep him occupied trying to get the food out. Container needs to be made of different material to prevent breakage but still worth the money for the enjoyment it has given him."
21812,B000KV61FC,A12HTYUARQWN3P,Hannah,1,1,4,1297987200,Good for fast eaters,"I put my dog's kibble meals in this so she doesn't gobble it up so fast.  She seems to think it's fun, and will work until she's gotten every last piece out.  I've had one for about a year and it's still in good condition except the rope is gross, so I wanted to replace it.  I ordered the small, which is pictured with a rubber piece instead of rope (thought it would be easier to clean), but I received a small with rope.  I definitely recommend this product as an alternative to the ""slow down"" bowls or for dogs that need extra stimulation.  I have a medium sized, non-destructive dog and this product does hold up over time."

However by 9 months old she figured it out and loves it! I give her kibble in here about 3-4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from breakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it - like mine does, it could definately break something. This is a great, durable toy at $11.92."

My 60 lb. mostly Dingo mix's strategy is to pick it up by the bottle and let it drop on the rope. When the rope hits the ground a few kibbled treats are released. This was tough for him to figure out. However, he has many different feeding toys and he doesn't give up."
21816,B000KV61FC,A94S2UKL5R2F8,Sportydog,1,1,5,1295740800,Great Lab Toy!,We have a mouthly labrador & this toy keeps him out of trouble.  He will carry it around all day long.

They quit playing with their other toys and carry these around with them.  I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.

Given that caveat I think this is an amazing product!  I actually have 2 (one for each dog) and it is their favorite way to get a meal.  It keeps them occupied for about 10-15 minutes but you can tell they are thinking and having a blast and they are generally ready to settle down and relax for a bit afterwards.  I have one with a real rope and one with a rubber rope.  Each has benefits and downsides.  I would recommend getting the large even for little dogs, my sister had a 4lb yorkie and he has no problem operating the medium/large size toy.  My dogs are a 25lb cocker and a 35lb mix so I cannot comment on the appropriateness of this toy for large dogs.  If the toy is too difficult you can take the rope out until they get the hang of it.  Also my cocker will sometimes unscrew the back instead of working each piece out through the top but that actually takes him longer so I don't mind."

Definitely one of the better interactive toys within it's price range.  The dog is supposed to pull the rope to get the treat out.  Well, my boy bypassed all that and within 20 minutes figured out he just had to tip the bottle to get the treats out.  I put bigger treats in to keep him busy for longer and some pieces I still don't know to this day how he got them out before I got home from work.  My only gripe with this toy, which is something the instructions don't tell you, is that the rope starts to stink after a while.  I cleaned it with dish soap a few time but that was only a temporary fix.  Put the rope in the washer and it frayed and came loose.  I'm now using and old medium width leash that I cut and knotted up on both ends (small enough to still let the treats out but not to have him spill all at once), which will also be easier to wash since I don't have to worry about fraying.

The only problem I've encountered is that one of the ropes fell apart.

I find that the cube, even on its ""hardest"" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.

Unfortunately it takes him less than an hour to empty it, so it's doesn't keep him as occupied as long as I'd like.  So far minimal/suspected wear (bottle is scratched up and some of the nibs of the rubber chew part are gone) and I'm waiting to see if he manages to untie the knot of the rope (like he has on another toy).<br /><br />Update 6/30/07: The screw on part has suffered some damage. It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it.  Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy. (So if I could I'd drop my rating to 3 stars.)<br /><br />Update 12/30/07: Now the rope is ""unraveling"" near the top knot and it's getting stuck in the opening, making it hard for even me to get the rope out enough to dislodge the food.

He is infatuated with it! He LOVES it! He is pretty angry and still hasn't figured out how to get the treats out (which suprises me because he is very intelligent).<br /><br />Negative: After very little effort the rope ended up in 3 strands. It is not durable or tightly woven at all. Also, I didn't buy the treats suggested to go with it, but rather broke our treats into tiny pieces......but it is actually hard to get the treats out! (Is a dog toy smarter than me?!)<br /><br />Overall, I love the product because it keeps my lab busy and content, but if you have a chewer, you may want to consider something else until they grow out of it, because this rope is done-for."

This toy keeps Max well-occupied for long periods on end.  I started out by really filling the bottle and using smaller treats that would more easily dispense, and once he got the hang of it, used larger treats for increased challenge.  While the tassel on the end of tug rope has been worse for the wear, the rope has withstood Max's chewing well.  Max has been able to figure out various ways of getting to the treats--rolling the bottle around, up-ending it, then knocking it over and tugging on the rope to dispense the treats...As the label says, Max is able to smell, see and hear the treats, and this keeps him interested for hours of play.  I've learned however, that I really have to screw the bottom on extra tightly, as on one occasion he somehow managed to loosen it by repeatedly rolling the bottle, and was able to get to all the treats at once! Suffice to say, he did not have much of an appetite for his evening meal after that!! At the same time I purchased this, I also purchased two Kongs; however, Max prefers the Tug-a-Jug hands down, and generally ignores his other toys--even his previously favourite tug rope--in favour of playing with the Tug-a-Jug All in all, Max rates this toy with 5-stars and thinks his mommy made a wise buy!"

The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the ""game"" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the ""mouth"" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game ""reasonably"" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope."

We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out.

Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- ""Rope"" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it.

They didn't seem to be too worried about the size once they realized treats were inside of it and it is a toy that they can grow into! If you have a smaller breed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it. Now they have mastered it so well that I am going to have to resort to the larger treat sizes! It keeps them busy for about 30-45 minutes at a time! Overall, very pleased."

We kept it out, though, and when he finally figured out his own system of getting dog food out of the jug, he was hooked!  Then we started putting all his meals in the jug instead of in his bowl.  Since starting his meals in the jug, Moby has an outlet for his curious energy and he spends less time in the trash can and in distructive activities like toilet paper shredding because he has to work physically and mentally for his meals like animals do in the wild.  It also occupies him while we aren't at home.  It lasts so much longer than a kong, because you can put a whole meal in it.  This is also great because you don't have to feel guilty about giving your dog too many unhealthy treats -- dog food in the jug works great because the kibble is the perfect size.<br /><br />I was watching the video of the woman who put in a negative review, and as an amateur dog trainer, I think I know why.  If you help your dog get food out of the jug, they quickly learn that the way to get food out of the jug is to bring it to the owner, so don't help your dog -- that ruins the fun of the toy!  Also, it's harder to get treats out of the toy if it isn't somewhat full, so just fill it up with dog food and a few treats in the beginning so it's not so difficult that the dog looses interest.  It also helps to put a few treats in the jug so they randomly hit a jackpot when playing with it.  As someone who's studied animal behavior, I know random rewards are the most powerful way to get an animal addicted to a behavior!<br /><br />In short, I can't say enough about this toy!"

This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)"

The rope is a weak point. I understand the theory that the dog is supposed to use the rope to chuck the bottle around and have the food come out, but after a couple of days our collie picked the toy up, took it across to her bed, and started determinedly chewing through the rope.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends you put the plastic practice golf balls in the jug instead of the rope, and this worked for a while, but then our dog started chewing the purple ball off the end of the bottle, and when she'd got sufficiently through that, managed to crack the neck of the bottle itself.<br /><br />We got her a replacement (as it took some weeks for her to crack the first bottle) and this time the rope lasted less than two days. So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.<br /><br />The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.<br /><br />1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.<br /><br />2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.<br /><br />Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray."

My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!"

We left the remaining 1/2 of the rope in the jug so that there would be some resistance to the treats just falling out.  A tennis balls works well too.

Granted, the interactive part is you helping your dog realize the toy's value.  Now, it is something that can occupy him for 20-25 minutes. He'll do anything for treats.  Although, I'm not sure that he really, really likes it but he focuses in on it until every kibble disappears. I think that it is good for him and makes him do something different to get treats.

Bulldog mix) needed a lot of help getting the food out while the rope was intact, but after he shredded the rope after about two days of gnawing, everything changed.  I cut the inside knot off and left it inside the bottle so that it would slow down the exit of the kibbles.  So now the kibbles come out much easier, but not too easily.<br /><br />Bottom line, with this slight modification, my puppy LOVES his purple bottle, and the 10 minutes that he spends throwing the bottle around to get his food out is 10 minutes less that he's chewing on things that he shouldn't be or otherwise being naughty."

She never quite figured out the ""tug"" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the ""tug"" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think."

I added some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSAJ96"">small tennis balls</a> to the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways.

Second round she graduated to that plus nosing it up the rest of the way.  Third she figured out putting one paw on the rope helped her paw it upend with the other.  She's also lifted it up in her mouth, open end down. In defense of the toy, she previously learned to do this with kibble in Kongs so she may already understand ""things that if tipped upside down dispense treats"".<br /><br />She's a pretty smart dog but of course everyone thinks their kid is the smartest in the class :)<br /><br />I've read suggestions on adding balls to it to make it more difficult, which would slow her down, but I was hoping to be able to increase the mental challenge not just reduce the randomness, so this now is as ""difficult"" mentally as it'll get.<br /><br />She's completely ignored the rope except as a way to upend it.<br /><br />On the positive side, it does provide her mental challenge, slows down her otherwise rapid eating, and isn't so difficult that she gives up or gets frustrated.

This Tug-a-jug is larger than our last; it is the Medium/Large size. Toby enjoys trying to get whatever I put into it and puts a lot of thought into it. He even prefers having his regular food out of it, even though he could simply go to his bowl to eat. The bottom easily screws off, I fill it with his food, a few treats of varying value and one extremely high value treat (EHVT) that really doesn't come out, but he has hope that some day it will. When I wash it, he gets the contents and thus the EHVT. He knows that I unscrew the bottom, but of course without opposable thumbs, alas he can not. Even so, he tries to figure out how to do that. Dogs can use a lot of energy thinking, chewing and exercising, so I like to give him a variety of each to keep him content.

I am sure over time he will better figure it out... but they have ways to make it more tricky.. ex: bigger treats.. etc.<br /><br />I have spent so much money on this dog.. on toys.. treats etc.. everything to try to make our lives eaiser. This is my fave so far!"
22002,B000KV61FC,A1YUQ7G3U6FRFZ,Armin,0,0,3,1298073600,Can be noisy,"Our dog likes this toy which we had gotten hastily at a drugstore when we realized we left her toys at home while on vacation. We fill this with Zukes or with crushed Nuturo choice snacks and leave it for her when we go to work. This can be a really long toy for your dog due to the small opening near the rope and it's good to check that what you put in will actually come out. Our dog gets her treats out be picking this up by the rope and then flinging it across the room (much to the chargin of the tenants below our apartment). She also just chews on the rope when she is bored and also tries to tug the rope back and forth in order to dislodge some of the treats. The best method for her however is to throw it and although it's durable, your wood floors may not like it and it can be somewhat noisy. But for this price, your dog will get a relatively long lasting treat dispenser that you can manipulate in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of earning their treat."

Kosner ""Red Hatted Frug Lover""",0,0,4,1297987200,My Puppy Loves This!!!,"I bought this toy for my puppy (She's a frug, 3/4 French Bull and 1/4 Pug) It took her a while to learn how to get the treats out. When she's a little hungry and she's in a hurry to get to the treats, she brings the jar to me so I can shake out some treats.  For treats we use Rachel Ray's Nutrish dog food. The pieces are just the right size for the Busy Buddy. The only problem we've encountered is that our puppy chewed up the cord. We've tried a few different cord replacements and haven't found one that works very well. We don't recommend letting your dog take it to bed (especially if he/see sleeps with you) because you'll wake up with pieces of treats ... well you just won't like it! Other than that, it will keep your puppy well occupied."

I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.<br /><br />Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball."
22005,B000KV61FC,A1RFDHX5W6HB74,W. Kepner,0,0,3,1296259200,OK toy if you remove the rope for safety..,"Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble."

At first she didn't know what to think of it and got a little frustrated that she couldn't get to her treats, but after a few times with patience and encouragement from mommy, she turned to a pro!  She plays with it so much and understands to stop tipping it over when all the treats are eaten.  She got a little too good and now I have to dilute her treats with dry dog food.  Best treats for this toy: Zukes Mini Naturals Dog Treats.  Pitfall: I hate the screw-on bottom; I can never seem to get it on right so I put all the treats in through the top.

It was recommended by the shelter I adopted her from, and it keeps her busy. I give hre about a third of her meal in her bowl, and the rest in the tug a jug.  It took her a few tries to get the hang of it, but now she rolls it around and has learned to put her paw on the bumpy part to tip the jug up and empty the food out. It works great with her kibble (eukaneuba adult maintenance small bites) but she goes crazy when I put her high-value treats in it like little pieces of string cheese.<br /><br />There are two down sides - one, since the rope never comes out, the part inside the jug gets kind of gross with all the food. its a little hard to thoroughly wash, but it can be done. Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to break the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in) - so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.<br /><br />I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything!

The  tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass.  If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by.  It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges.  Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!

I have a Chihuahua-shaped vacuum cleaner of a dog who is utterly obsessive about food, and a neurotic Shep/Lab mix who will turn her nose up at food in a bowl, yet gobble up ""found"" food. These toys are the ideal solution for both dogs. The Chih works harder to get the food out (we have the med/large size jugs, so they're pretty big for him to manipulate), which means he's burning off calories. He tends to be a bit of a chub, so this is a good thing. The Shep/Lab mix has an easier time of it, but the toy keeps her occupied and she seems to enjoy it. I've just adopted another dog from the shelter, and gave her her own Tug-a-Jug. It's great for her b/c she has to stay crated a lot right now (healing from her spay surgery, plus the vet put her on very restricted activity while she recovers from an upper respiratory infection). I make sure to put the jugs away when I leave the house (don't want anyone fighting over food), but they're wonderful for when I'm working from home and need to keep the dogs busy while I'm on the phone with clients. (Murphy's Law of Dog Ownership #1: Your dog will bark like a freaking maniac - but for no discernible reason - the moment you get on the phone with the client you've been trying to reach for a week.)<br /><br />Our experiences with these toys have been great, so I heartily recommend them.

I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby - the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.<br /><br />I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either - the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.<br /><br />On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.<br /><br />I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted - it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog."

What I did not keep in mind, is that she is scared of anything that relates to people, even if it has food in it (she is a shelter rescue). She likes me getting food out for her, but never got into bouncing it around to figure out how to get food out herself. Two weeks later it is lying in a corner, ignored, full of yummy treats. I still think this toy has great potential, but I don't recommend it for a timid dog, that gets spooked easily. My dog loves her Kong chew toys.

Both dogs enjoy working their breakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.<br /><br />When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I ""primed"" the jug by spilling out a couple high-value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.<br /><br />The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.<br /><br />I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large-chested breeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time)."

We came across the Tug-a-Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw-on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).  The first one I got for her, the cord was much more frayed on the inside so it took longer for her to get all the food.

Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.

I got this last summer for my very anxious, smart 2 year old pit bull rescue to keep him occupied while working. He is very destructive to his toys but doesn't eat what he destroys. He spends an hour or more a day playing with it , not including while we aren't home. At first I fed him only from this toy, but now he's calmer so I feed him in his bowl too, but he generally prefers to feed out of the toy. I knew when buying he would chew the plastic rope off immediately, and he did. Some come with a nylon rope, which would take longer to chew off. Since I have the large, and the rope is gone, I put in one or more large treats (depending on how hard to dispense I want to make it) and regular size hard dog food and a few small treats that will fit through the neck. The rope definitely blocks well and can be replaced; for me it was easier to put a larger dog treat in to block. With the rope I needed to use small bite dog food because it came out very slowly, and he would lose interest.  Interestingly he loves the enlarged end of the plastic rope to chew on (not good for swallowers). Very sturdy and easy to fill as long as you line up the spirals. He's never opened it. He knocks it around with his paws and nose and grabs the neck with his mouth and throws it around. So far no damage, but it is sturdy and could possibly break something when tossed. Worth the slight risk. After almost 8 months he began to chew off the plastic ring around the neck, which he loved doing, and does attract him to the neck where the treats come out. Recently he started chewing the neck off, which is why I'm buying another, but I plan on using this one until he gets down to where the neck is gone, as it still works and he still loves it."

I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.

She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle."
22119,B000KV61FC,A1JL5ZJYDBNY9V,Kelvin L. Cheung,3,5,1,1240099200,Wish they hadn't changed this toy,"I originally purchased this item back in March of last year.  It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day.  This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug.  After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I then purchased a replacement end of last year.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one.  This toy lasted about 15 minutes before my dog had completely chewed through it, making the toy nearly useless.<br /><br />5 stars for the original version, 1 for new and unimproved."
22120,B000KV61FC,AUCEUTMJBY8MP,S. Linton,1,2,5,1343692800,Great petsitter!,"If you have a dog labeled ""destructive when bored"" DO NOT pass up on this toy! It's absolutely the best puppysitter. It's been three months, but when I put her kibble in it I still know that she's good for about 20 minutes while I do dishes or whatever. I hate constantly kenneling her when I need to focus on something, so this has been wonderful because it lets her play so much longer.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />- Totally entertains her for a minimum of ten minutes<br /><br />- Can hold her dinner and then some, I can adjust her playtime with how much I put in it. The less I put in it the longer she plays<br /><br />- Easy to load treats in. just unscrew the bottom and you're good!"
22121,B000KV61FC,A23FG04WAXU8WQ,Jennifer L. Lantz,1,2,2,1339113600,Too much for pup,I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.

22124,B000KV61FC,AJNJI8L53U59F,Addy,1,2,1,1336435200,"Good in theory, not in practice","I got this because everyone says it's great for your dog to play with when he's alone. My dog has several treat dispensing toys to keep him busy: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B11L46"">Atomic Treat Ball Interactive Dog Toy, 3-Inch</a> , <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG"">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>, and Kong Puppy Kong Toy Medium. He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work."
22125,B000KV61FC,A1ITKSZ9ZQFTGK,AMB,1,2,2,1334275200,"Great Toy, Impossible to Clean","Purchased this for my 3 year old Dalmatian who suffers from separation anxiety and boredom when my husband and I leave for work.  We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time."

He would get all the treats out of the KONG so I decided to get him another toy to keep him occupied when I was away. The first few days he attempted to get the treats out of the busy buddy were not successful. He would sniff, push, sniff, push. The hard plastic made a lot of NOISE. Sometimes Juneau would drop the KONG down a flight of stairs to get the treat. I didn't mind the rubber KONG bouncing around. But imagine hard plastic hitting my hardwood and marble floors!<br /><br />After a week of use, I had trouble getting the cap back on. I found myself being the Busy Buddy, trying to get the cap to stay on! We tried to like this product but it just had to go back. I can imagine this toy might be better for those with carpet."

Otherwise it would be impossible to get the food out!! Maybe this is because his food is larger I really dont know however, with the rope gone he stays active until all the food is out. Good buy since I purchased it from target at the clearanced price of 3 dollars!"
22129,B000KV61FC,A2T89T26FO5Q8J,sierralynn,1,2,2,1315180800,Not for a large puppy or chewer,"I bought this for my 6 month old lab puppy. He figured out how to get the treats and it was his favorite entertainment. However, he swung it around from the rope (it's made to do that) and within weeks had broken the plastic top by hitting it against the floor so it could no longer be used. For a $20 item, I expect longer use, and to have plastic shards around a puppy is just dangerous! Great toy/food dspenser in thoery, but just too fragile!"
22130,B000KV61FC,A1Z7YPU3POXN3,Atmosfera,1,2,1,1313452800,Really for puppies!,I bought two of this bottles because I liked the principle but ended up realizing that this toy was basically designed for puppies.<br />The two bottles I bought lasted no more than two weeks with my German Sheppard.<br />The main problem is that this bottle is hit on the floor and walls at the time the dog is trying to get the kibble out of it. It cracks and is basically a dangerous toy for adult dogs that will end up eating part of the plastic.
22131,B000KV61FC,A1FHXN6HBHVZ8E,Elatedrunner,1,2,2,1306800000,Great idea - poor quality rope,"Well this certainly didn't last long with my german shepard mix puppy.  It less than an hour she had shredded the rope, splitting it into two pieces.  Once the knot in the jug dropped to the bottom she was able to empty all the treats quickly.  I used it again with larger treats inside and no rope.  That worked for about 20 minutes until she ripped the nub coating off the neck of the bottle and started crushing the neck portion.  I had to take it away and toss it, getting only 2 uses and less than 2 hours out of it."
22132,B000KV61FC,A1OA06LPHX3HGG,Mitch G.,1,2,2,1306022400,Broke the first time it was used,"I wanted to like this item and had seen the generally favorable reviews.  I loaded it with some liver treats and opened our front door to offer it to my dog-- she grabbed the rope and released it...and it fell about two feet onto the step and cracked!  I was pretty surprised it took that little to break it.  The crack was on the screw-in bottom so it spread and basically the bottom broke and it was useless...back to Amazon, sorry!  Maybe a rubber guard for the bottom would make this a better product?"
22133,B000KV61FC,AXYOVYG27O75G,Ashley Adams,1,2,1,1297728000,NOT for genius dogs,I bought this on the recommendation from someone that also had a siberian husky.  All i can say is that their husky must be fairly old.  My 6 mth old siberian husky is very active & a heavy chewer.  She figured out how to unscrew the bottom of the jug in one day-then proceeded to chew it to pieces.
22134,B000KV61FC,A1AO04N12KAQ0R,Buddy,1,2,1,1296864000,Lasted one day,"This is a great idea and I had such high hopes.  My 8 mo old Shepherd is very active and rough.  We have tile floors in the house and concrete outside.  The dog slung this toy around, knee capping me a few times  before slamming it on the tile floor and breaking it open.  It it were made of hardier material I would buy another but this plastic is just too brittle for a rough dog."
22135,B000KV61FC,AYE92900MGVJK,JmeRae,1,2,1,1296000000,Good for a couple days,"My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However, before I could even place a ball in it, the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors. He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage."
22136,B000KV61FC,A3MXGI3CNE33ZO,ACB0006,1,2,3,1291248000,Loved the toy but the indestructible plastic broke!!,"I have a 3 year old black lab named Layla who LOVED the busy buddy.  It got to the point where she enjoyed having some of her meals put in the toy each day.  Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc.  After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest.  I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!"

I was looking for new toys to keep my 1 1/2 yr old Lhasa busy.  This did keep her busy.  It kept her busy trying to get at the treats that she could see and smell without any reward.  The treats only come out when I turn it upside down and play with the rope.  I felt bad watching her trying to get the treats, and she tried so hard for such a long time. There is no way she would be able to turn it upside down.  It is also SO loud.  We had to take it off her the first day because my husband and I could not hear each other talking!  It was a waste of money. We will stick with Kong dispensers."

He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then."

I recommend going one size down from what they recommend.<br /><br />Also - although my dog loves playing with her stuff-a-ball toy, she will barely go near this thing. So - the one doesn't necessarily imply like for this item.<br /><br />I suspect this would work best for a dog with strong food motivation. My doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />As a toy, it's not much fun, unless a dog really wants food badly and is willing to put a lot of work into it."

Not worth the money,"I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats.  Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the ""rope,"" which didn't take long to tear in half.  I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.  He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any!  So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong.  He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.  In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash.  It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!"

She wound up frustrated, barking at the treats which she could clearly see... ""they're right there in the bleepin' jug"". She spent some time trying to figure out how to open the bottom of the jug. I guess she thought she had a better chance of getting the bottom unscrewed than getting the treats out by holding it at just the right angle with her paw while tugging on the rope. Sorry Vi"

He needs to be mentally stimulated so I bought this toy for him. He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber ""rope"" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt. It just gets dirty and hard to clean."

This is the best toy I've found yet to keep my overly smart dog challenged.<br /><br />I've used Kongs filled with loose kibble, then kibble mixed with yogurt, kibble mixed with cream cheese or peanut butter, then kibble mixed with one of those and frozen. After 2 months of increasingly challenging Kongs, my dog finally graduated to the point that Kongs don't keep her busy or engaged for long. I also had been filling the Premier Waggle with her kibble, and she takes care of those pretty quickly too and seems to have gotten bored of the one repetitive move she used to get food out.<br /><br />So I got the tug-a-jug. My dog figured out how to get food out right away, which was disappointing -- then I realized I could put big chunks of treats in there to make it smell enticing and harder for the smaller food kibbles to come out. It works!<br /><br />I love that you can customize how hard it is for your dog to get food out by putting in objects that are too big to come out. I filled about half the jug with freeze-dried liver. Then, I put about half a cup of kibble per meal. It takes my dog a good half hour to get out all her kibble, and she really seems to love shoving, nosing, and flinging the jug around. She used a greater variety of movements than with the waggle, which is probably more fun for her.<br /><br />I also love that the jug is SO easy to fill! Kongs and even the waggle are annoying because they have small holes you have to shove the treats into, but the entire bottom of the jug screws off so you can just scoop the food in. Fast and easy, and my dog is delighted. Totally worth the $."
22173,B000KV61FC,AWN8ZV815QHJF,R. Ross,3,3,4,1264377600,Better than the Buster Cube; almost as good as a bully stick,"We bought the ""small"" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats/kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the ""rope"" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug-a-jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation."

We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes."

She's easily bored, extremely destructive & likes puzzles. This looked perfect. It takes a bit of work to get food out so I knew this would occupy her for a while. The screw-on lid at the bottom of the jug was virtually seamless and very tight. When I ran my fingers over the seam before giving it to her I could barely feel it.<br /><br />I gave it to her at 8am before I went to work. I came home for lunch at 11:30 and she had COMPLETELY destroyed it! She located the seam and, somehow, wedged her teeth into it, worked her way around the circumference and pried the lid loose. She then chewed the lip off of the jug all the way around so the lid cannot be put back on it. She was lying there calmly and the food was all gone, so she had clearly long since finished all this in the 3.5 hours since I had given it to her."

I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds."

It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a ""competive eater"" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having ""intestinal turbulence"" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the ""easy meal"" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.

Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck.

One, I would never use it in a house with hardwood floors, especially if you are noise sensitive! The bottle is quite hard and it does create a lot of noise if your dog becomes on who picks it up and slams it on the floor, as one of mine does.  The other spins it around and as a result is a bit quieter.  There is also no way of regulating how fast treats come out of the jug.  Once the dogs learn the concept of the toy, most learn not to touch the tug, otherwise you restrict toys from coming out.

The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the ""scent holes"" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately."

Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible.

It's a great toy for dogs that inhale their food and need some stimulation so they keep out of trouble. My dog is not a light chewer so I was worried that he would chew this to pieces but after a couple of months this toy remains intact. LOVE IT!

It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!"

My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.<br /><br />When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x/day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13-year-old Labrador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat-dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short-lived."

The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried, so I decided to purchase a second one. My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't ""play"" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding."

I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!

Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!"

We have been using the jug about 8 months and have stopped feeding our dog with the dog dish and now only use the Jug. It takes him several minutes to get his food out, keeps him entertained and he actually chews his kibble instead of inhaling everything in 10 seconds like he would do out of the dish. The jug can also be filled with treats and is a great tool for dogs with attachment issues. For example, our dog used to go nuts and tear up the house when we left, but now we fill the jug with kibble before we leave to keep him busy. It keeps his mind occupied long enough to forget about us leaving and as a result he no longer becomes destructive when we are away. If you have a dog that is too smart for his/her own good and needs a good toy to keep 'em busy then I would recommend the Jug hands down. I have gone through more dog toys in the last 18-months than I care to admit and this has been the most effective, long-lasting items that is actually worth more than what you will pay.

Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes ""how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?""  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo -- may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn."

I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good.

The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.<br /><br />The other rubber/plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug/bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing!

Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.

She finally figure out how to put it upright, knock it over, and then pull on the rope to pull the treat out.  the clear container and the smell holes keep her interested in the toy.<br /><br />the only thing that isn't good about it is that it can be noise on a hard floor."

He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.<br /><br />The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet."

They're both much more interested in playing than eating, but my vet was adamant that letting them graze all day would make house training significantly more difficult.<br /><br />The answer has been to make their eating more of a challenge. We've got two oversized Kongs that we'll fill with their breakfast, but they eat out of the kongs very quickly. In the evening, we needed something that would keep the puppies busy for at least ten minutes, so one of us could get some food in our own mouths before it was time for the pack to go out.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug has been great. Both puppies are challenged by it, but not so challenged that they lose interest. There's a perfect balance between work and reward. It holds a lot of food and assorted small treats, it's pretty easy to load, and the beasts haven't figured out how to unscrew the bottom lid.<br /><br />Some of the pictures for this product on various websites show a rope. Mine actually came with a silicone ""rope"" that's got a cone shape at the end, which ensures something gets scooped to the neck almost every time they pull on it.<br /><br />Only downside for my two is that if the food drops below a certain level they lose interest... might be because it's too much work, or it might be because they're full. Either way I have to make sure to dump the leftovers into a kong or a dish at least once a week so they get to eat the food before it gets stale."

Whilst others may consider this a mistake, (as I did at first), I got to thinking....WHY NOT list it under ""Health amd Personal<br />Care""?  The ""health"" ingredients in this scrumptious little candy bar are as natural as most un-organic food -- especially candy -- is today,  Yes, I'll admit that ""sugar"", ""corn syrup"" and ""hydrogenated palm kernal oil may not be the best for one's diet....but they ARE natural products, not chemical facimilies.  The other ingredients are natural too....the one exception being ""artifical flavours"".  Oh, well...the scrumptious flavour of this treat...plus the money one saves by not buying fancier and/or organic chocolate, (at least, not all the time), can easily make a person sleep better at night, as the thought of bank interest compounding, (or stocks going up, etc.), leads to more relaxation, and better sleep!<br /><br />Also, ""3 Musketters"" has 45% less fat than other typical chocolate snacks!<br /><br />So much for ""Health"" benefits of ""3 Musketeers""!<br /><br />And ""Personal Care""?  You bet!  Eating one of these wonderous little bars makes one think one is eating a chocolate confection at the court of Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI!  (And or the courts of Peter The Great,<br />King Mongut of Siam....or any other monarch, or at the mansion of any rich and famous person of your choice!)  It is SO easy to forget the ""gourmet"" quality of this smooth little treat, because it is so readily available in candy stores, mom-and-pop groceries, huge supermarkets, and online!  However, the smoothness of this confection, and it's sweet chocolate taste, should not be taken for granted!  There is NO sticky nougat, and NO ""pesky"" nuts, to draw attention from the wonderful texture and magnificient flavour!  (I have read that ""Preppie"" food is boneless...probably skinless and without fat, as well.  No difficulty in prying meat or fish for the upper classes!  So, too, can a readily-available ""3 Musketeers"" be considered an<br />""upper-class"" treat, even if it doesn't carry a huge price tag.  Nothing interferes with ""chewing pleasure""...it's just ""chocolate fluffiness"", covered with a darker chocolate topping!<br /><br />(True, if you favour ""rocky road"" ice-cream, then ""3 Musketeers"" Bars may not be for you.  But if you like your steak or fish fileted, and your flavour in your candy-bars to be sweet and true, ....THIS is your snack of choice....just as it is mine!)  Deluxe, inexpensive....wow!  What a bargain!  And it even has the ""OU"" (highest-quality kosher) symbol on each wrapper, as well!<br /><br />If you want to cut calories and fat still further...and/or want a second type of treat from your ""3 Musketeers"" bar, try ""volumiizing"" it.  ""Volumizing"" is a calorie-cutting technique, which can easily be done with a ""3 Musketters"" Bar.  Simply put some milk, (whole, skim or dry), intro a blender, add one or two ""3 Musketters"" bar(s), and whirl away!  Presto....the best ""Malt"" available, outside of the ones I used to have in a neighbourhood, Brooklyn, NY candy-shop as a child!  (In fact, you could even add malt, (Carnation Instant...also sold by Amazon.com), to make a super treat!  Or place ""3 Musketeers"" bars inside a cake batter, for an additional taste experience!  Recipes for this little gem of a snack seem endless!  And no nougat, sticky caramel, or nuts, to get in the way!<br /><br />One thing I miss from the ""3 Musketeers"" bars, as they now are packed, is a picture of Alexander Dumas' 3 Musketeers, themselves, For, of course, it is from this novel that the candy bar gets its name.  Althos, Porthos, D'Artagnon,....where art thou?  Thy pictures surely USED to be on this bar!  This scrumptious,  easily-eaten fluffy little chocolate concoction, which surely would be at home in any French, or other Royal Court, reallt needs your pictures on it again!<br /><br />In the meantime.....bite into this wonderful, easily eaten, chocolate confection masterpiece!

As the other reviewer stated, I've honestly never tasted peas that were so fresh and sweet.  I would never have thought that dried baby foods would produce such a fresh looking and tasting end result, but they look and taste so much better than anything that is canned or in the plastic pouches.  I tried buying fresh or frozen organic peas myself and making my own pea puree but it never came out as nice as these.  When I used fresh or frozen peas my baby wouldn't eat them because I was never able to get the pea skins pureed fine enough and he kept choking and coughing while he ate them.  I make my own sweet potato, squash, blueberry, etc. but these are really the only green vegetables that he seems to love.  My only complaint is that they can be hard to find in supermarkets or big box stores.  Thanks Amazon for keeping them in stock.

It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.

It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.

I like reduced packaging, but in this case, the product suffers as a result, and several (10+) of the packages were open and perhaps not safe for use.  The other issue is the packages are more than a few months old at the time of shipment.  Several months ago Kellogs started adding fiber to certain cereals, including Special K, and these do not have any fiber- they are probably working off old stock. In spite of all this, I would purchase again- these are great for portion control, which is difficult for cereal, and these would be perfect for food service, day cares, day camps, churches and other groups. I plan on throwing some in my suitcase for travel- most processed prepackaged foods are approved for entry into other countries and these will be good on the go. Hopefully in the near future Amazon will get newer stock with the added fiber.  Make no mistake, Special K is not something most people would consider healthy- high fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients and with the lack of fiber, this is little better than a kids cereal, but I do like it for a treat when I am craving something sweet.

The tea-leaf flavor itself is quite nice - the subtle flavor of South Carolina's black tea is interestingly different from what I drink on a daily basis, and I like that change every once in a while. Also, the tea leaves seem very fresh.  I like the Governor Grey and Breakfast teas for a simple, linear-tasting black tea, but there are still other brands I gravitate toward for more complexity (Mighty Leaf has a wonderful Earl Grey with stronger bergamot flavor).  The problem with this particular tea is that the peach flavoring is strange and sometimes reminds me of chemically scented plastic (a warning sign of artificial flavoring).  I did double-check to make sure the ""peach flavor"" mentioned in the ingredient list is natural, and the website for the Charleston Tea Plantation affirms that a natural essential oil is used in all of their teas, but the peach tastes so chemical compared to other, more natural teas I've had - you know, the teas that have visible bits of fruit in it.  When I checked the reviews on the Charleston Tea Plantation website, I noticed that someone else had left a review mentioning the same chemical taste.  This tea is refreshing and easy to drink, but I just can't get over the weird peach aftertaste that lingers just a bit too long and too strongly.  Maybe it's just a personal preference (many other people seem to love this tea), but I'm going to stick with Green Hill Tea's peach apricot loose tea because it is much better, and the ingredients seem better (taken from their website: black tea, natural dried papaya, freeze dried peach + apricot, blackberry leaves, sunflower + calendula petals, natural flavours)."

22438,B0000TVV0E,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,Themis-Athena,7,9,5,1157673600,Magic Potion from South America.,"Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits -- among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals -- the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts."

There's hardly any grit to be found in the clams themselves (as sometimes happens with the shelled critters like these, mussels, scallops, etc.).  Add them to whatever you want (I've stirred them in with a homemade marinara sauce and a few spices) or eat them separately.  My one concern was that they'd end up being rubbery, as clam bits tend to be, but these are very small, pretty much yanked whole out of the shell, and quite tender yet firm.

I especially like the toffee flavor which I put in my fake coffee.  It is evidently a popular flavor because it is often out of stock on the various website that sell it.  I don't use caffiene and real coffee has a wickedly bitter after taste.  Stevia has completely replaced sugar in my kitchen.  I use it in everything from cereal to baking.  This is a good price.  I like the Sweet Leaf cream soda, but it is expensive. Their toffee flavor is too strong.<br /><br />I am surprised by the number of reviewers who use artificial sweetners, such as the exotoxic aspartame- NutraSweet (the most poisonous), Sweet N Low (at least the body recognizes it as a chemical so it doesn't pass through the blood brain barrier), Splendia, Sucralose, etc. Now there is a new toxin spewing from the malevolent (yes, what would you call a company who has developed anti-nature terminator seeds?!) Monsanto called Neotame, which is unbelievably being labeled as ""organic"". Stevia is actually good for you. I try to avoid any product, especially food, that is made in China, although it is nearly impossible to do these days, particularily if you shop at Wal-mart (the great Wal of China).  By the way, aspartame is a terrific ant killer and Sweet n low is rat poison.  I am surprised that they aren't used in chemotherapy.  I reckon these chemicals aren't expensive enough to use in ""medicine."""

Among the very finest bourbons.,"Four Roses distillery is currently producing some of the best and most exciting bourbons in America, which may be news to you because that's a relatively recent development. Four Roses was a venerable 19th century brand and a top seller in the US until mid-century when then current owner Seagrams decided to export the good stuff to Europe and Asia and debase the brand by only selling low end blends in the US. That's how it was for almost 50 years. It wasn't until 1995 when master distiller Jim Rutledge came (and ownership changed a couple of times) that the brand became something good again. And not just good; extraordinary.<br /><br />Four Roses makes a range of special limited releases as well as their standing specialties. Like a lot of high end bourbon distillers, they also make a single barrel version that varies from cask to cask. But Four Roses takes it a monumental level further by actually varying the recipe used to produce the bourbon - with startling different results. The ten different recipes Four Roses uses are described as followed on their web site:<br />From the Four Roses web site: ""Four Roses is the only Bourbon distillery that combines five proprietary yeast strains with two separate mashbills to produce 10 distinct and handcrafted Bourbon recipes, each with its own unique character, spiciness and rich fruity flavors.""<br />...<br />""What the letter designations mean for the 10 recipes:<br /><br />O = Designates produced at the Four Roses Distillery in Lawrenceburg, KY.<br />E = The mashbill that is 75% corn, 20% rye, 5% malted barley.<br />B = The mashbill that is 60% corn, 35% rye, 5% malted barley.<br />S = Designates straight whiskey distillation.<br />V/K/O/Q/F = Yeast strain used to create flavor characteristics.<br /><br />And here are the 10 recipes - along with the descriptions of flavor (and some have listings of the releases that featured that recipe:<br /><br />OBSV - Delicate Fruit, Spicy, Creamy - Four Roses Single Barrel - 100, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release, Limited Edition 2010 Barrel Strength Bourbon<br />OBSK - Rich in Spiciness, Full Body - Small Batch, 120th Anniversary<br />OBSO - Slightly Fruity, Spicy, Medium Body - Four Roses Small Batch<br />OBSQ - Floral (Rose Petal), Spicy, Medium Body - Limited Edition 2011 Barrel Strength<br />OBSF - Mint, Fruity, Spicy, Full Body<br />OESV - Delicate Fruit, Fresh, Creamy<br />OESK - Spicy, Full Body - Four Roses Small Batch, The Mariage Collection 2008 Release<br />OESO - Fruity (Red Berries), Medium Body - 40th Anniversary Barrel Strength Bourbon, Four Roses Small Batch<br />OESQ - Floral, Banana, Fresh, Medium Body - 2009 Limited Edition Barrel Strength Bourbon<br />OESF - Mint, Fruity, Full Body<br />....<br /><br />In this review I'm tasting a single barrel bottle from barrel 22-1B, warehouse BN, bottled at 53.6% using recipe OBSQ.<br /><br />In the glass it's orangy copper new penny amber colored. The nose is sweet with honey, clover flower and the tang of grape noble rot (rancio in the cognac world). With more time more classicly bourbon notes of toffee and leather creep in<br /><br />First entry is sugar beets with a rush of vinous rancio, white raisins, sherry notes. Mouth feel is silky with good but not thick syrup factor. Spicy around edge of tongue - 107.2 proof showing up. Herbal notes proliferate in the transition to the finish: cilantro and parsley... Maybe some ivy. As the glow fades the oak tannins join the medicinal herbal edge of bitterness and the honey and the sherry-cognac rancio ends up feeling almost dry. This is a sophisticated and elegant flavor profile that feels almost more like a wood aged European eau de vie than a Kentucky bourbon but inhaling as the long finish fades brings up echoes of burnt sugar, leather and tobacco conjured out the fading viney and herbal flavors so I know this is Kentucky Straight bourbon whiskey. Just bourbon of a higher and more refined sort.<br /><br />This bourbon is so good, so different, so unique, I can't wait to try other single barrel expressions. I'll be looking out for them."

Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant.

This tea tastes amazing and there is just a burst of amazing spices and flavours that come out of this tea.<br />Downing something is not healthy. If you're consuming something for everything but taste then you're doing it wrong. I enjoy this tea because it goes down nice and smooth and leaves a very pleasant after taste. As one reviewer said, it leaves a nasty after taste. I would not agree. I believe it to be a very relaxing and just overall awesome after taste.<br /><br />If you have some kind of stress disorder this is probably not the tea you want. Now I'm no tea whizz but I don't really think that getting this tea for it's ""relaxing effects"" would be the way to go. I get it because this was a delicious tea and I'm sitting down with a cup as I type.

Unfortunately, I can barely palette this tea because of its wretched last note and after-taste of Stevia. I have never tasted Stevia before, but after reading the other reviews I instantly knew that was the issue. It goes into my throat and just tastes disgustingly sweet. Not in a good way, either.<br /><br />I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea. If they're going to do that, perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing this again, and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that aren't sweet, fruity, or minty."

""Sarah""",0,0,4,1288051200,Worked around the metallic taste,"I tried the Yogi Kava Stress Relief tea after being a user of Valerian root in my herbal tea for a while a year or so ago and having some success with that but wanting to try something different - I was finding myself in a situation where on most days I needed to get up at one consistent time but then one day of the week I needed to get up three hours earlier, thus causing a great amount of upheaval in my sleep schedule the night before and then after that early morning.<br /><br />As some earlier reviewers have noted, there is a strong, almost metallic note to this tea. I have tried Stevia as a sweetener previously and had not particularly cared for it, but that did not seem to constitute the entire ""note"" that I was sensing and not finding pleasing here, so some of it must be the herb itself. However, this taste is not any more displeasing than Valerian is to my palate when I compare them.<br /><br />I steep two of the teabags for approximately 7-8 minutes with the water almost a boil when I add it to the tea (the instructions said that the tea could be steeped for as long as 10 minutes). I add just a splash of cream and a generous tablespoon of clover honey to mine, and within twenty minutes I feel the effects. Some have noted that they do not feel any differently - I can say that I do, but I should mention to be fair that I am a mere five feet two inches and barely clock in at above one hundred pounds.  Still, I would say that this is to its credit - it wouldn't put me to sleep if I used one teabag for test anxiety, which I foresee using it for in the very near future. Instead of knocking you out, it simply stops your mind from racing relentlessly, or at least that has been my experience."

I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.<br /><br />It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it.

Other flavors run about $2, plus or minus, and make either a gallon or half gallon.<br /><br />Most important, they are unsweetened, leaving it to the customer to provide any extra sugar desired.  This is, of course, crucial for those trying to control their sugar intake, simply as calory control or because of diabetes, hyperactivity or other conditions.  But also it allows one to avoid the oversweetness of so many bottled juices on grocery store shelves, either due to the sugary apple / grape juice base or even added sweeteners.  If you choose to try any of the Da Fruta juices, I'd suggest you start with no added sugar and gradually add a few spoonfuls at a time (to that gallon or half gallon, not per serving!) until you reach your comfort zone.  I've been leaning toward the little-if-any sugar end of the spectrum lately, and find the result very refreshing and thirst quenching.  Of the two products I have in hand at the moment, the passion fruit has 2 g of sugars per serving (19 servings per container), and the cashew has 3 g of sugars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have freshly squeezed juices to compare these concentrates with, nor even any other equivalent products (such as bottled whole or frozen concentrate).  They are nothing like the heavily sweetened canned ""nectars"" that are available in some groceries.  Considered on their own, they are flavorful, tart and refreshing, and allow you to mix to the strength and sweetness desired."

Far and away the best ""instant"" soup on the market, I find myself frequently craving the soft noodles and intense flavors found only in Annie Chun's soups.  I have tried all of the varieties, and the new Vietnamese Pho soup has shot to the top of my favorites list.  Very savory broth, you will definitely recognize the flavor if you've enjoyed real pho in a Vietnamese noodle house.  This is not a spicy soup--if you prefer it with a kick, I'd suggest investing in a bottle of Sriracha sauce.  Obviously, one of the major selling points of Annie Chun's soup bowls is the convenience factor.  Nevertheless, this soup makes me want to grab some fresh cilantro and bean sprouts and have an authentic pho experience at home!<br /><br />Since everyone's tastes differ, as a matter of reference, my other favorite Annie Chun's Soup flavors are the Tom Yum, the Kimchi (although it's in the upper range of spicy that I can handle), and the Miso."

The noodles are firm without being too tough like some of the Annie Chun soup bowls.  I really liked the huge pieces of green onion in it as well.  Good product and my new favorite flavor.<br /><br />Huge downside?  1940mg of sodium per bowl, which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal.  Ouch.

It's definitely a step up from cup o noodle or ramen noodle packs, but still lacks something that'd you'd get from just making the dish yourself (I think the freeze dried vegetables don't have as much flavor, and the noodles aren't as good as fresh noodles).<br /><br />If you like instant soups, ramen noodles, or any of that stuff, I strongly recommend checking this out, you won't be disappointed."

22542,B002BCE9JS,ARRNOA2H9V4ZZ,J. Hale,1,1,3,1298937600,"Hardly pho, but not bad with a lot of work","I knew it was a pipe dream to think this product would be 'good' pho, but as an avid pho lover, I had to try it. The verdict? It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of ""pho"". It still isn't quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done."

I guess it's a matter of individual taste and preference with these things.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste good either.  Not a lot of flavor, and what little flavor it did have I wouldn't describe as Vietnamese (or even Asian for that matter).<br /><br />I've also read a few reviews describing the portions as big, but it definitely was not.

I try not to eat a lot of carbs these days, but I always steal a few bites when I make them lunch.  The creamy-cheese sauce is more reminiscent of a good, light alfredo than of the nasty, gluey, neon-orange stuff you get from the big brands, and whole wheat macaroni is mildly flavored (and therefore and easier transition for kids and processed-wheat addicts)."

This works perfect for dinner as none of the kids are hungry before bed, something that was always a struggle. They really do like it. Whenever I make it there is never any left.<br />I do add the optional butter (real butter (unsalted)) to the mix as it adds a better smoothness to the cheese and a nice flavor kick. It is highly recommended that the cheese sauce is made separately. Cook the pasta an extra 2-4 minutes than normal, pre-melt the butter and warm the liquid in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute (I make it in a batch of 2-3 depending on if the bring over friends). Then add the cheese packs 1 by 1 and mix with a whisk, until smooth.

I don't even want to know what would come out of the spout.<br /><br />So, 1 teaspoon/8 ounces of water for 1.5 - 2.5 minutes (2.5 is even pushing it) and you'll get an amazing green tea that has the subtlety and smoothness that you're supposed to get out of a green like this. If it's bitter or you feel like you're on a green tea roller coaster, you've brewed it wrong."

Bright green color, fresh aroma, and a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />As the directions indicate, be careful not to steep the tea for too long and in overly hot water. When I leave the leaves in hot water for over 4 minutes, the color of the tea is no longer a clean green, but rather a yellowish green and it doesn't taste as good. Correctly prepared, it is one of the best green teas I have ever had.<br /><br />I usually bring water to just under a boil and steep the leaves for about 2 minutes. If the water does boil, I pour in some room temperature water and then mix in the boiling water. Using the same leaves, the first cup tastes awesome, the second tastes significantly weaker, and after that I don't really like the flavor anymore.<br />Also, use filtered water of some sort for the water if you can!

No, I'm not stretching the truth; I still have it, and I'm considering sending it back. It smells like cut grass, and tastes like cut grass. Maybe I have a defect?

I remember waking up after my first experience with the capsules and having to think really hard to determine weather or not i had just been dreaming or if what had just happened was real. The amount of dreams i experienced in one night with at least 5 caps was double if not triple what i normally have, although no lucid dreams yet and I'm not sure if it helps my ability to lucid dream since it makes my dreams seem even more real. but this did not work right away, and i would not expect any thing super crazy to happen. start off small to gauge your own personal reaction to it and go from there. the effects of this are very subtle, but it will change your dreams I'm sure of it."

When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness.

The first night, I filled 3 gel capsules with the tincture and went to bed and felt NO EFFECTS WHATSOEVER!  If anything, I remembered less dreams than I usually do on any given night and had more disturbed sleep.  I had read another review about this herb requiring more of it to perhaps experience lucid dreaming... Emboldened by the fact that I wasn't allergic to it, I measured out 20ml and this time drank an over the counter sleep drink that contained melatonin with it and went to bed after 45 minutes... Nothing. Again. Waking up in the middle of the night over and over again with no dream recall which is LESS than my day to day.<br /><br />So, I figured that maybe it has a reverse tolerance...So the third night, I took 30ml on a mostly empty stomach...By now, the taste didn't bother me as I have been used to tinctures before and this is by far not the worst. I had noticed some muscle soreness the nights before and started to get some of this this night as well...Still, no dream recall; and this coming from someone who recalls a dream daily.  Some sleep disturbance but not tired because of it...So much for third time's the charm...<br /><br />I waited for a few days and figured one last go around; a fourth time...I had dreams that I recalled on the days without it in between the third time and the fourth time...I tried 30ml again and on mostly an empty stomach...Not only no dream recall but woke up earlier than I normally do...I don't feel overly tired from waking but certainly no dream recall, much less any lucid dreaming...<br /><br />This may work for some folks, but at price over $30, with no return policy and the bottle more than half gone, I am disappointed thoroughly.

She had cataracts and could hardly see and her eyes gradually cleared and she can see well enough to catch a toy thrown to her. She had arthritic hip displasia and had to stretch for 10-15 minutes in the morning before she could walk. Now she hops right up in the morning and bounces around the house with our two younger dogs (one a year old). We determined by switching around dog foods that the shepherd is allergic to chicken. Just about all other dog foods have chicken meal or something chicken added to them. The ingredients in this dog food are baked lamb (not lamb meal) and the preservative is vitamin e rather than artificial preservatives. This is the only dog food that works well with all our dogs. I have only found one other prepared dog food with as much or more protein per mass. I am not even sure that advertised claim is accurate.

This blend has a lot going for it, though. It brews really strong! So you don't need to use a lot. I use one tablespoon to a 15-oz mug! This is definitely a mocha, so coffee purists may not like it much. It has no aftertaste. Very smooth and rich flavor. After you kick your caffeine monkey, you will not miss coffee much with this alternative. So, it tastes great, rich, smooth, with no aftertaste, and it's economical. I'm going to try their mocha, which has no chilies in it. That should be just perfect. I have not tried some of the others as yet, so maybe I'll like one of them better, but I have a feeling that this will stay my favorite, since I like flavored coffees better than straight, unless its Guatemalan, which I love but can't drink anymore!"

It has a deep, rich flavor like coffee, that tea just doesn't have.  I tried making tea lattes as a substitute at first, and they just didn't cut it.  Honestly, I would sometimes pick this over coffee.  It is really good.  The chocolate flavor is delicious.<br /><br />I put two Tbsp of this in my portafilter and pull a shot as normal.  You do need to scrub out your filter a bit afterwards and your portafilter needs to be completely dry before putting the teeccino in or it will stick together in a clump and the shot will not pull right.  It is stickier than coffee.  I also enjoy this as an iced latte.  For an extra treat, put a Tbsp or two of cocoa powder into the bottom of your glass, mix with the shot, then add milk and sweetener of choice, make a great iced mocha.  I use coconut palm sugar, which when mixed with steamed milk creates a kind of marshmallowy taste.  Combined with the teeccino, yum!"

It is incredibly tasty, though. I have only tried this flavor, as the spicy chocolate was right up my alley. It isn't all that spicy when prepared, though, unless you make it uber-strong. I made the mistake of getting this package-- didn't realize it was the espresso grind--it is pretty fine, and I was using a strainer at first and now a french press, neither of which removes all the tiniest particles. It works just fine in a drip coffee maker, though--I tested it with my mom's. I would get the coarse ground next time, though, since I don't have a drip coffee maker.

Instead, these almost remind me more of a bread and butter pickle, sugar is used in the brine along with garlic and dill.<br /><br />Having said that for those that like a sweeter pickle instead of a more sour dill this would easily be a five star product, since it was my mistake to buy the wrong type of Polish pickle I'll still rate this product 5 stars. What impressed me even more is that the only ingredents were the cucumbers, vinegar, water sugar, dill and whatever other spices were used in the brine, no preservtives were used at all. So for those wanting a true all natural product, this is it.<br /><br />Addendum:  To clairfy, I looked up polish dill pickles on a couple sites, and I have to admit it was due to myself being clueless.

Plenty of time to share and consume these delectable treats from Scotland, the producer of my favorite whiskeys.  Although the Amazon description states that this package includes, ""Shortbread in five distinct shapes,"" the cookies are actually in three shapes.  Included in each box are 4 rounds, 6 triangles, and 8 of the traditional fingers, totaling 18 cookies.  They are fresh, golden, attractive to the eye and satisfying to the tastebuds.  It's quite interesting that the boxes list the ingredients in many languages, but English is not included.  They are made of wheat flour, butter (33%), sugar and salt.  Walkers shortbread makes a gift that would likely be appreciated by any person who enjoys buttery confections that are slightly sweet who is not allergic to milk, wheat, gluten or nuts, is not vegan and has either teeth or rigid gums for chewing.  The biscuits which are about 1/2 inch thick soften when wet, so a full set of teeth is not required.<br /><br />When in a crunch for entertaining purposes, I've dipped the shortbread halfway into microwave melted bittersweet chocolate and then into chopped toasted pecans.  There's no need to limit yourself to a plain shortbread when you can create a desert worthy of oohs and aahs in a matter of minutes.

There was also no rain of any note that may have washed it away.  I don't think the rain since has washed it away either though, as I can see a residue on some of the leaves on some plants that were sprayed and left high up in a place where rabbits couldn't get to them.  Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived. Again I was coming home to check on my plants and finding more bitten off leaves and decapitated lilies. I stopped checking before leaving for work because it would put me in such a bad mood every time I'd see more ""victims"".<br /> I just hate spending almost $20.00 for something (I was so desperate that I paid the extra 3.99 for 1 day even though I am a prime member) that in the end did not work as it should have.

Lawless,3,4,3,1335744000,A bit disappointed.. but my cats love it.,"Original Review: My favorite thing about this cat food (besides that it's good for my cats and they love it) is how you can actually tell that it is REAL chicken and REAL veggies. There is no second guessing, it doesn't even look like cat food. Love it!!<br /><br />*Update: I have 4 cats and I have noticed that after switching to Fussie Cat food their fur seems to have lost the natural oils which give them the 'shiny' healthy look. I looked this up and it could be from poor nutrition. I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I found that adding some Omega 3 drops to their food helps. I tried switching but they really like their Fussie food. :P"

Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.<br /><br />If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done."

22834,B001EO61AO,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B. Riley,14,16,4,1234742400,One of my favorite fats,"Given that we are living in a time when (at least in the US) we are told that fats in our diets are bad for us, it is a real pleasure to find an item like this.  I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.  Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course)."

The taste is distinct and quite good. My first use was with some braised pork. I had made enough for two nights, and the product arrived for the second night. I sauteed the pork and carrots in half a unit of duck fat to reheat. The rich flavor much improved a dish that is anyway always better the second night. Half a unit was plenty. The richness was a very good addition to the pork and carrots that had been braised without wine and therefore somewhat plain. I see this as being something I keep in the pantry."

OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me-and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after-effects like I often do with regular coffee.

My general preference runs to darker roasts, taken black.  I prepared the Puroast in a Technivorm Moccamaster, though I did back down to a bit less than the full three ounces against 10 cups of filtered water.<br /><br />The result was disappointing.  The brew was strong enough, and certainly presented a low-acidity.  That said, the flavor is fairly flat, with almost a chemical or plastic undertone.  There is no complexity to the brew, where even a run-of-the-mill Folgers offers some flavor signature.<br /><br />For someone who cannot tolerate the acid in a typical cup, it is coffee.

This is great idea for low acid coffee but I just add water on half the amount of regular coffee and add normal amount of creme or sugar and milk and add water to the regular coffee's half portion to make it diluted. That helped so far. You are also supposed to drink this with coffee cake or something to help pass it. Not straight without anything in it unless you love that.

The smell of coffee is appetizing and enhances the taste, but since I already had an issue with the smell, the coffee ended up tasting weak and stale.  The process of removing most of the acid must affect the taste and smell as well as color because it took away the best parts of coffee, the appetizing smell, the rich slight bitter taste, and the dark, smoky caramel color.

I grew up in the 60s with a younger brother who needed to use sacchrine on everything because of his diabetes. Sacchrine is absolutely no sugar substitute. Anyone who has used it knows.<br /><br />The Puroast Low Acid is really not a bad alternative if you need a low acid blend because of acid reflux, sensitive stomachs, etc. Was it weaker than what we're used to? Certainly. Is it bolder than, say, Folgers medium roast. I would say that it is. Though milder than most bold roasts (that's a dead giveaway in opening the pouch. But that is probably because of its finer grind than even the mild and medium roasts with a coarser mill. The finer the grind, the lower the aroma retention. Yet, because it is a finer grind, the taste is much bolder than the smell would give away.<br /><br />This is also a smoother tasting French roast than I was expecting (possibly because of its fine grind), but it was a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />The cost and the flavor may be inconsequential to those who do really need a low acid coffee. For that reason, it was hard for me to rate using the star system because I am a coffee lover without a low acid need. Perhaps someone with a low acid need finds that this coffee is superb and would otherwise give it four or five stars.  If you are a regular coffee drinker, any flavor that isn't cultivated in what you are used to will make others, especially weaker blends seem more inferior than they probably are in reality. When I was in Asia, there were times when I would go weeks without a cup of coffee, and after that, the mildest of blends tasted oh so good to me.<br /><br />Although I was unable to try it in an espresso machine, the finer grind lends itself to espresso; and that may be something you might want to try with this blend to kick the flavor up another bold notch or two.<br /><br />Another possible idea is to use this blend in a French Press (yes, although I know the finer grind isn't typically conducive to the Press; perhaps a filter may be used).<br /><br />If you suffer from acid reflux, sensitive stomach, etc., this may be very worth the try for you.<br /><br />If you don't need the low acid beverage, stick with your standard brands."

If you are to that point, I would recommend this coffee as a good alternative, but if you are not quite to that point, this is not a substitute for great coffee. It's good enough to compete with the pre-ground mass-market coffees but doesn't match up to the more premium beans. It has a mild, nuttier flavor than I'm used to, and a hint of aftertaste comparable to a diet beverage.<br /><br />What confuses me is that the description claims this is a good choice for decaf drinkers looking for a more robust flavor.

I had to stay away from Dark Roast, Gourmet and even Decaf because of the acidity level in regular coffee.  I missed coffee!  Missed the smell of it, missed the warmth of it and quite frankly nothing else really perked me up better than a cup of old fashioned Joe.  So, when I saw the chance to review Puroast's low acid coffee (French Roast) I was intriqued.  I opened the bag and immediately the yummy french roast aroma wafted up into my nose and filled the room!  Ok...so you had me at first sniff.  Let's see what it takes like before I get excited further.  As I was scooping it into the coffee filter I noticed that the grind is pretty fine.  Almost powdery like.  I found that interesting.  I also was wondering why THEIR coffee was low acid...what was the difference in the overall process?  So, I went to their website and found this:<br /><br />Brew coffee's acid content and bitterness is greatly dependent upon the roast degree, type of roaster, and brewing method. As shown in the table below Puroast® coffee chemistry is unique and different from all of its competitors because Puroast® has a patented slow roasting method known as conduction roasting; which uses renewable fuel and exposes the coffee beans to a lower temperature for a longer period of time. This process is significantly different from the convection roasting method used by other coffee companies that employs a natural gas heated process. This roasting process is also called flash roasting because the coffee beans are exposed to high temperatures for a short time period.<br /><br />These people have done their research!  Check out their website: [...] and see for yourselves.  I was glad to see the process did not include any funky chemicals (like in the decaf process of other coffee manufacturers).<br /><br />I decided to forego my antacid the morning I tried this coffee to see if my GERD would act up.  I even had the nerve to try the coffee black which I never dared before.  It was delicious and I had no symptoms of heartburn or reflux all day.  I tried it the next morning and again drank it black (without any antacid prevention) and I noticed a little bit of heartburn but thought maybe it was because I was trying too much too consistently for my delicate system.  So, I skipped a couple of days and tried again, this time with some skim milk added.  I was fine.  I think the low acid really is helpful but I don't know if people who have really severe heartburn or GERD can drink it daily but it is nice to know that I can keep it in the house and enjoy a cup of coffee with company now and then."

(You know, that lovely smell that wafts up from good strong coffee.)<br /><br />I stuck my nose into the packet, and over the pot when it finished brewing, and still, not much aroma. Same thing in the cup I poured. (Taken with one sugar, a little half-and-half.)<br /><br />So I was pleasantly surprised that my first cup had a nice, rich flavor. It was very smooth, with no bitterness. But...there was an unusual sort of ""aftertaste"", that I really couldn't identify.  So I waited about fifteen minutes, and fixed my second cup. The rich taste had faded some by this time, but that aftertaste was still there.<br /><br />I think if this coffee is brewed and consumed quickly, the taste is rich enough to be satisfying, and the aftertaste may not be something everyone notices.

Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee."

It is not too strong and definitely does not have an after-taste that is the trademark of mixed bean coffees.<br /><br />This would make a great first-cup in the morning coffee. I tried it both ways - one cup with cream and one without and both were delicious.  I also tried it with a piece of Ghiradelli dark chocolate squares and the result was  'passed with Distinction'. The only factor going against this product is its cost.  At around $9.00 a pound it will probably be prohibitive for most household budgets."

He was the test subject because he loves coffee, and can rarely drink it.  He's had 2/3rds of his stomach removed... TWICE.

There were no instructions as to amount to use on the package of coffee, so we had to guess by dead reckoning (to be honest and fair, even if we'd used a regular brewer, we still weren't sure how much water to put with the three ounces... we imagined that it would have been six.  So we looked at a video on YouTube from Perfect Pod which showed how much they put in, and we followed suit.  What came out, was, according to my Dad, ironically ""weak.""  We probably should have put in more, but the portion we'd used was exactly half the bag, so we didn't have enough left to try it again.  On the positive side, he suffered no ill effects from what he ingested, so that's a promising prospect..<br /><br />My Dad and I have ordered a one-pound bag of Puroast coffee to try again, this time the House Blend.

I decided to do it exactly as I normally do with FOLGER's or other brands, aiming at ten cups of coffee based on three scoops of the ground beans. Those three scoops used up about 3/5 of the contents of our free sample. I will try the rest tomorrow.<br /><br /> And here are the agreed opinions of us both:<br /><br />-- (2) PUROAST coffee felt very soothing in the stomach - immediately. Here was something better than any other coffee we had ever tried. Here, a couple of hours later, I am still grateful for a sense that PUROAST soothed my agitated innards. This is a quality to build the brand around, no doubt.<br /><br />-- (3) Neither wife nor I found the taste pleasant. It was far from vile. We didn't feel compelled to stop drinking. As I write, I am still sipping my second mug. I am no expert on evaluating coffees, but if I put my mind to it I could probably describe five different flavor sensations. My wife and I discussed our sensations.<br /><br />First, I asked her: ""Does this remind you of POSTUM <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DGQK1Y"">1904 Vintage Ad Postum Coffee Substitute Caffeine Free - Original Print Ad</a>? -- a drink I don't like.

To me the underlying flavor reminds of POSTUM, a very STRONG POSTUM.<br /><br />Second, it tasted bitter in the mouth, though felt soothing in the stomach.<br /><br />Third, something reminds of wood shaving being turned into charcoal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: My wife and I are both tempted to explore further the concept of ""low acid coffee"" and to order other varieties from the company's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We are keeping an open mind. In my case I hope to find another blend that reminds me a bit more of coffee and a bit less of POSTUM.<br /><br />-OOO-"

As such, it will not taste like Folgers or Eight o'Clock, or whatever regular coffee you're used to drinking. French Roast really describes how the coffee beans are roasted: rather than being removed from the roaster as soon as the beans crack (which is what happens with lighter blends), they're left in until the crack a second time. The result is a very strong, very dark, very full-bodied coffee which is -- by nature -- lower in acid than other blends. That said, if you're used to the lighter blend, this WILL smell incredibly strong and even over-powering. I, however, love French Roast for my first cup of the day since it's basically like drinking an extra-large espresso.<br /><br />As for this particular product, I was somewhat annoyed by the 'low acid' claim since ALL French Roast coffee is lower in acid than lighter roasts. But, setting that aside, I found this to have a wonderful, deep flavor and more body than any grocery-store 'French roast'. (Yes, Folgers, I'm looking at you!)

So when this was offered, I decided to get it and have my friend try it. Well, low and behold, she liked it without any ramifications concerning her reflux. If she had any complaints, it would be that the French Roast flavor was a little on the strong side. I am sure that could be adjusted with coffee to water ratio, but that was one of her complaints. That aside, she was quite hyper afterwards, which she liked the energy it gave her (at first), but then started to have the shakes (but this is probably due to lack of caffeine for some time). I dont know if there is lots of caffeine packed into it or she just made an unreasonably strong cup of coffee. Her words were ""it has very good flavor and a very robust coffee"".  I don't think she is a convert to this particular flavor, but if she found ""regular"" coffee, she would get it, but found French Roast a little too strong for her liking."

I tried it plain and found it bearable (keep in mind my lack of coffee taste) and then with some milk and sugar which I really enjoyed. To make sure I was enjoying the coffee I kept my sugar and milk in check so it was a cup of coffee with milk and sugar and not a cup of milk and sugar with some coffee added. That said the expense of the coffee may keep most none coffee connoisseur away but if you are in the none coffee club but are thinking of crossing over this is worth a try.

However, after using a very dark roast, strong coffee for a while (I don't want to give the brand because I'm not slamming it or anything) we both noticed we were getting more heartburn than usual. So when I saw this product available through the Amazon Vine program I decided to try it. This coffee is very finely ground and and very dark in color. I noticed it has a slightly different smell than other coffees, though I can't  describe it well. It's  a sweeter and less sharp odor than most coffees have. However, when we brewed it, we found it made a dark, smooth, very flavorful coffee. Both of us knew what it was, so I can't say for sure if we would have noticed anything different about it if we hadn't known ahead of time what we were drinking. We both liked it and thought it tasted as good if not better than other coffee brands we've tried (and we've tried most every popular brand: our favorites are Starbucks and Folgers). What I can't answer yet is the question of whether or not this coffee would be a better choice for those with recurring heartburn.Neither of us had any heartburn after drinking it, but we only got enough to make two small pots through the Vine program, and we haven't purchased any more.  If you find coffee is giving you heartburn but you don't want to give it up, I would definitely recommend you try this coffee as it tastes as good as other brands on the market that are not lower in acid."

Something about aging that I'm just not enjoying.  So when this came up to try, I thought it was a great idea!  As a caffeine addict from way back, I can't give up my morning cup of joe just because of a little stomach acid!<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not a fan of French roast.  I refer to it as ""French burnt"" because it really tastes burnt to me.  So, though this still tasted burnt, it didn't taste different than any other French roast I've had.  So no marks off for that.<br /><br />It comes already ground, and wow, is it ground!  It's like powder, which I don't like.  I usually use K-cups, but when I get ""real"" coffee, I prefer it whole bean because it 1) lasts longer and 2) I can grind it the way I like, which is quite a bit more coarse than this is.  Puroast has taken care of the ""lasts longer"" issue because this comes in small bags.  I don't like the powdery grind though.  I use a French press, and the powder tends to get through the filter.  This should work well on a regular coffee maker with a paper filter, but this really isn't the best for a French press.  (Puroast does make whole bean as well - yay!)<br /><br />I didn't notice an increase in heartburn, which is really great.  Of course, I didn't notice much of a lessening either.  It's possible my morning coffee isn't my problem, so I'm not going to mark off stars for that either.  (The product description says it helps 90% of customers - I'm apparently special.)<br /><br />A coffee snob probably wouldn't go for this (Pre-ground???  Really???  Please!) but for the rest of us, it's not bad.  Again, I don't like French roast much, but if you do, then this should taste all right.  (My husband likes it.)  There's a strong flavor, but it's not bitter.  It comes in small packages, so even though ground, it shouldn't get stale.  It won't make your heartburn worse.  The price seems a little high ($24 for 30 oz or 10 packages), but you can save with Subscribe & Save, and if it helps with your heartburn, then it's worth the price."

I've been ordering directly from Puroast for about a year, but I'm really glad to see their product is catching on and their distribution is getting more aggressive. I was even able to find it in my local supermarket a couple weeks ago when I suddenly ran out of my Puroast mocha java.<br /><br />My wife stopped drinking coffee a couple of years ago because the acid helped contribute to discomfort she had due to IC (interstitial cystitis). She began drinking only peppermint tea as a hot drink, and that, along with some other dietary changes, helped her a lot. I also had some problems with urinary tract discomfort as well as stomach acid discomfort, but I couldn't stop drinking hot coffee cold turkey (LOL) and read about Puroast. I tried it and it has become a staple in my daily diet: one large cup a day. Recently, my wife decided to try a cup every now and then, and so far she hasn't had any problems at all due to acid.<br /><br />The coffee tastes full-bodied even though Puroast does something proprietary to reduce the acid in the coffee. The French Roast has plenty of rich coffee taste. I happen to prefer more of a medium roast, but that's just me. All the Puroast coffee varieties that I've tried are plenty good enough for me--with the distinct benefit of low acid. You can get beans or two different grinds, and they sell the coffee in small packets as well as 1-lb, 2-lb and even up to 5-lb bags. They also have flavored coffees, like the mocha java I mentioned above.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great find and a great addition to Amazon's product lines for people who would like to enjoy the foods and drinks they like but need a reduced-acid alternative.

I filtered the coffee the first time I made it, but it is better suited to an espresso maker, whether a traditional Italian one that goes on the stovetop or an electric machine.<br /><br />The coffee has a rich, strong, slightly bitter taste - it is not mild like Sanka or a decaffeinated coffee.  I would not describe the taste a smooth, but it's not incredibly rough.<br /><br />It did not irritate my throat. I was unable to test the acidity myself and when I received my review packages the vendor's website showed links to Dr Taka Shibamoto's site at UC Davis, known for its food research, who had tested the coffee. On the Puroast website the link to the research paper is missing. This concerns me.  The vendor has their own documents, with detailed analyses, on its website - which needs updating so it looks less amateur. I am not a food scientist or chemist, so cannot comment on whether the coffee has unique characteristics.<br /><br />I did visit a gourmet coffee shop that sold a wide range of coffees from all over the world who said they had encountered some less irritating coffees with low acidity.  So when Puroast claims that its coffee is lower in diCQA acid than other coffees it is being compared with well-known brands like Starbucks and Hills.<br /><br />The individual foil packaging keeps the already ground coffee fresh, tasting like coffee ground freshly from beans.  It definitely had a kick and woke me up.

This is the first time trying ""low-acid"" coffee for me.<br /><br />I normally buy whole bean coffee and grind it myself, this coffee was already ground and was not nearly as fresh as I would like, but the initial aroma was still good. I prepared it with a french press at home using purified water at 190 degrees.  I let it steep for four minutes and then tested the aroma again.  It reminded me of the typical store brand type coffees, not bad, but not as layered as I am used to.<br /><br />I sampled it first as regular black coffee with nothing added.  It has the right flavor and character for a french roast, with a little bitter aftertaste that I felt was appropriate.  Then, I added half & half with the second cup which is how I usually drink it.  This being my preference, the flavor improved to just above average.  However, after two cups and an hour wait, I am not having any symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux that I would normally have which is a nice improvement.  In fact, I am surprised how little this has bothered me.<br /><br />In summary, while this coffee being already ground was not a fresh as I am used to, it is much easier on my stomach than any other brand I have tried so far and the flavor is good enough that I would try it again.

It's quite amazing the difference this low acid coffee can make to your stomach and I could even drink the entire pot of the stuff! Normally, I take coffee completely black, no additives whatsoever.

Combined with cream and sugar, then no problem.<br /><br />I tried this coffee just wondering if I could really tell the difference between regular and low acid coffee.  There IS a difference! The flavor is quite good but doesn't end smoothly like oh, say, Folger's might, but this is a gourmet coffee and will carry a stronger punch than a commercial coffee like Folger's will.  I plan on trying a different roast too since my tastes are more towards a full-bodied coffee instead of the kind that tastes like it was made in Texas during the Wild West days!  This ends a bit rough, kinda like the Starbuck's Verona, not as smoothly as I would prefer.  I made it with bottled water, not tap, to get the full flavor and aroma, so keep that in mind when deciding on which flavor to choose.  I am going to continue to play with this flavor to see if I can get it to suit my tastes better.  If you try it and it's too strong, then I suggest you dump the pot onto your roses!  Makes them quite gorgeous, actually!<br /><br />This is a great product, particularly if you're looking for the low acid variety.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better low-acid coffee out there.  But, if you're like me and prefer a more smooth, well-rounded roast, then I suggest you try one of the other roasts.  Great product, highly recommend!"

Because I was not able to brew more than one pot, I cannot adequeately comment on how this coffee might affect someone who suffers from acid reflux anecdotally.  I assume that the target audience (and only buyers of this product) would fall into that catagory, and sadly, I cannot advise you fairly on how this is going to affect you gastronomically.  Also consider that each case of GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) is widely variable based on the individual, therefore this product might be fantastic for some and still too acidic for others.<br /><br />So at this point you may be wondering, should I buy this?  Sure.  Start with as small a quantity as possible, test it for yourself, see how you like the flavor and whether or not the ""low acid"" aspect of this coffee meets your expectations."

I like bold, dark roasted Indonesian coffees. I usually drink a particular blend from Starbucks, what they call Komodo Dragon.  I've found other coffees that I like, from various sources, but this particular coffee can be drunk black, unsweetened, and it is missing a layer of nasty bitterness that is pretty uniform in Central American washed coffees.  About the only new world coffees that are missing some of this nasty layer are Brazils - Santos has its own problems but the layer of bitterness that the Central American washed coffees have is at least partially gone.<br /><br />That coffee is a blend that has changed over time.  At its height, it was a five star coffee, now it varies between 4.5 and 4.75 stars, not reaching 5 stars anymore, but almost everything else is just so bad that I can't drink it.  I've had other Indonesian blends, they are missing the nasty bitterness that you find in so much of the standard coffee that many people just love, and which are highly rated.<br /><br />What Komodo Dragon does have, on its better days, is depth, complexity. There is a bold coffee flavor, of course, but there are other things going on. When I drink it, the second sip is different from the first one. The third sip is different from the second.<br /><br />So I was prepared to hate this coffee, and then after a couple of sips of this coffee, I was prepared to like it...and it just left me...wanting...something, some depth, some complexity.  The best coffees - again, my favorite Indonesians, have more than just coffee flavor. As you sip the coffee, there is coffee flavor, and then there is another layer of flavor, like when you drink a good single malt islay scotch, or a fine port that has cost you 50 bucks for a bottle and you don't regret it, even if you only can afford to buy a couple bottles a year...there is grape and then there is fruit, berries, flowers, fields of heather for Scotch, or groves of cork trees for Port.<br /><br />With coffee, there are faults, like if you can smell the shed, or the burlap sack that the coffee was moved in, and then there are positives, like when there is a layer of chocolate in the coffee and you have not put any chocolate in, or when there is a satiety factor - you drink a cup of black coffee and it is so flavorful, so complex that you start hungry and you end not hungry.<br /><br />Now this coffee is workmanlike - it has coffee in it, the blend has almost no bad flavors, no flaws. It is actually missing a lot of the bad flavors, bitterness, that I dislike in Central American washed coffee that everyone drinks in ground coffee these days. And if I went into a restaurant, I would be pleased to get a cup of coffee of this quality.<br /><br />But in terms of possibly replacing the coffee I drink everyday? No, not yet.  Do NOT get me wrong. I do get acid stomach, acid reflux some time. If my acid reflux was caused by coffee, and I could drink this without it kicking my acid into high gear, I would thank my lucky stars that I had stumbled into a coffee of this quality that I could drink.<br /><br />Many years ago, there was a commercial low acid coffee, it was sold under the Kava brand (It was not the mildly narcotic drink from Fiji.

I see that it is still available, at least as instant coffee. It is as bad as any instant coffee is, with no redeeming social value other than it is a low acid coffee, suitable for people who love coffee and can't drink it.<br /><br />This is a HUGE step up from that.<br /><br />So that is how this coffee gets four stars.  On the scale of acid neutralized coffees I know about, there is Kava, which might or might not be mostly Vietnamese Robusta, and then there is this stuff, which, if all you had tasted was American supermarket instant coffee, or stuff like Maxwell House<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK"">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a>, would be nectar of the gods.<br /><br />I can't give it 5 stars, though. A five star coffee is going to have complexity, it is going to have depth, it is going to have a wonderous deep, level that is as much more than coffee as a fine single malt is more than Jack Daniels.<br /><br />If coffee were whiskey, this coffee is more than Jack Daniels, but it is sort of Canadian Club.

When I got my first real full time job, I would easily drink a pot of coffee every day.  However, as someone with a lot of gastrointestinal issues, coffee is a huge dietary sin.  The caffeine and acid could do me, and spur stomach aches that would last for days.  When I was officially diagnosed with acid reflux, my doctor told me to cut all caffeine out of my diet, cold turkey, until things were under control.<br /><br />Now that I have learned how to control my gastro issues, I am once again worshipping at the shrine of the coffee bean.  Since I began working again, I make a small pot daily.  But I quickly find myself feeling icky from drinking coffee.  So when I learned about Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I was thrilled.  It caters to people who have acid issues but love coffee.  I was thrilled to get to try it.<br /><br />My first impression was WOAH, this coffee is strong.  I am not a huge fan of french roast coffee, I tend to like a milder blend.  Once I got over the initial taste, and adjusted my milk and Splenda accordingly, I started to really enjoy this coffee.  While it was fresh and hot, it was pretty delicious.<br /><br />The problem with this coffee is when I returned to the pot for a second cup.  This was probably within 20-30 minutes of brewing, and the heating unit was still on.  But the coffee did not taste fresh at all; it almost tasted as if I had reheated coffee from yesterday.  It actually tasted more acidic that my normal coffee does.  So, I had to throw the rest of the pot out.  Because of this, I just cannot tell if this coffee really does allow someone with acid issues to enjoy a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the french roast blend; another blend may have better results.  I would certainly try another flavor, because as I said, the initial cup was fantastic.  If this could be purchased as a resealable container, I may be more likely to purchase it, and make only a cup or two at a time, so as not to waste it.

Frankly it won't qualify as a great cup of coffee.  The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.<br /><br />The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.<br /><br />(Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)<br /><br />So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI"">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?

But coffee is a big no-no for those with GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disorder).<br /><br />I brewed it up in my Chemex coffee maker (all glass, no plastic parts).  My first impression was that it is a dark roast, which I'm not particularly fond of.  (The company, according to its website, offers two styles of coffee.  The dark French roast was what was sent to me.  They also offer a 'nutcracker sweet' flavor).  Secondly, the grind is very fine, which releases more flavor, but takes longer to drain through my filter.<br /><br />The taste (which is the important thing, right?) is strong and slightly bitter.  When I added sugar and creamer, the taste was tamed into something more than I'd like.  The flavor is unchanged from a regular coffee flavor, which is certainly a big plus.<br /><br />I could tell right off that the coffee was less acid than traditional coffees.  And it certainly didn't set off my GERD (though mine usually comes later in the day).<br /><br />One caution I'd issue though.  According to the pamphlet on GERD I just picked up from the doctor's office, one reason (the principal one?) that one should avoid coffee and certain sodas is the caffeine in coffee.  I assume that the coffee has all of the 'kick' that traditional coffee has.  So it seems that one drawback to coffee (acid) has been solved, but the other (caffeine) remains.  I'll finish off this small bag and see what I think.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'd recommend this coffee to the lover of a strong dark French roast.

I also learned that coffee in its natural state is low acid but the roasting process converts coffee to a high-acid drink.<br /><br />Puroast has seven times lower acid levels than the leading brands of coffee. That is good news for people who suffer from heart burn, acid reflux, and other kinds of stomach irritation. Puroast Coffee [...], rich has its roots in South America, introduced the low-acid brews in November 2005.<br />Puroast comes in regular, decaf, medium roast, house blends, and organic blends in either whole bean or ground format. Among the low acid flavors Puroast offers are chocolate almond, hazelnut, Irish cr&egrave;me, mocha java, and vanilla.<br /><br />Puroast coffee products are available at amazon.com and a major chain store I refuse to shop at.

23140,B004ZIER34,A1EX5SK2PD0XLC,Kenneth Sandberg,0,0,4,1311638400,"Different, gentle, mild flavor","I'm somewhat ambivalent on this product; you can tell from the get-go that it is quite mild, almost gentle on the taste buds (and almost nonexistent on the olfactory senses). It comes in a 3 ounce foil sealed packet (I got 10 in a set); the coffee is very fine (almost like dark brown sawdust from a 320 grit sandpaper).  I would compare this product to ganocafe classic; the two are similar in texture and flavor (except the ganocafe comes in 1 ounce packets and has no caffeine).  One of my slight problems with this product is it comes with NO DIRECTIONS.  I assume you just measure out what you would usually mix for your coffee and put in your drip coffee machine and process as usual.  However, the ganocafe just mixes directly with hot water (very convenient if you are on the go or whatever); I have the feeling you can do the same with this product (just mix directly with very hot water).  The question is how much product to what quantity of water should the ratio be (ganocafe is one ounce to 6-8 ounces of water).  I guess one of the true tests of coffee is how does it taste (or can you even drink it) when it is cool (not iced, not hot); this coffee is still drinkable even when cool.  If you are looking for a product that will not mess up your stomach, I think this product will do the trick.  (However, as a final plug, ganocafe will also do the same thing; however, ganocafe is expensive, and you have to go through a bunch of hoops to get it--like become a distributor, buy at least 60 dollars a month of the product, etc.--I did for a while, accumulating years worth of the product--since it is in tiny foil sealed packets, it will last for years).  Note the four stars is primarily because I believe the product will do as advertised (the low acid amount) and the taste is acceptable (true connoisseurs of coffee will turn up their noses at this product). UPDATE:  I got sample packets; the ""regular"" item DOES COME WITH BREWING DIRECTIONS.  You also can't brew it directly in a cup (just add hot water will not work without complications.  Their phone connection system was excellent, no automated garbage, quick real live person with answers who actually lives in the U.S.  Oh, ALL coffee has some caffeine, just how much (sorry about my earlier comment). One final thing, there is a cold brew coffee  technique called Toddy Coffee; you just put a pound of coffee in a special plastic container, put in some cold water (first 4 cups, then 5 more), let it sit for 10-12 hours, and drain through the filter at the bottom.  You then heat up water and put whatever amount of this dark liquid in the water (usually two parts water to one part liquid coffee. This cold process coffee is extremely mild, much like puroast, except you have your choice of which coffee you want to use.  The downside is you have to use a full pound of coffee (well, you can halve the recipe), and you don't get that much actual coffee (liquid).  Still, it tastes great."

One of the amazing things about human physiology is that our stomachs are designed to successfully hold that caustic solution.  Our esophagus is not, and when the sphincter between the stomach and throat is weak - even momentarily - the stomach acid splashes up into our esophagus and causes the familiar ""heartburn.""<br />Methylxanthines are common substances that will relax the sphincters in our body, and they're found in high quantities in caffeine and chocolates, for example.  So - how useful is a ""low acid coffee"" in preventing the actual cause of heartburn if it has the desirable caffeine?<br /><br />I wrote the Puroast people and pointed out these things and they wrote me back with links to research done by biochemists on coffees.  I was still scratching my head over what to write in my review when I got an email from the CEO of Puroast! Yeah, I was surprised!  Anyway, he wrote:<br /><br /> ""Puroast does not make a claim as to the correlation between the pH<br />of its coffee and the causes of heartburn/reflux, only that the coffee has<br />significantly lower acid content (up to 80% lower) than leading commercial<br />brands.""<br /><br />So - ""Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions."" - isn't a claim that there is a correlation between the ph of its coffee and the causes of heartburn?  Am I being trivial to point out that their product description misspells ""symptom"" and that the package I received misspelled ""gourmet?"")<br /><br />So - is it good coffee?  It ain't bad.  It's absolutely worth drinking on the basis of its flavor alone.  But is it worth >15 bucks for 10 one-pot bags?  I'd try the larger bags first.

I thought I'd botched the brew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.<br /><br />That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed.

As a coffee: it's not the world's best cup of coffee. If you're not dealing with the acid issues, you won't find this worth getting for the flavor. The package I had was not bad. It was ok. When I brew coffee, though, I'm looking for a little better than ok.<br /><br />2. As a value: I'm not sure this is good in terms of value. First of all, I typically make coffee in a 4-cup mini brewer, so I only need about half the package size here. Second, most of the time the extra packaging for single-serve raises the cost a little bit. So, it's not a real good value.<br /><br />3. As coffee for someone with heartburn: Here's the kicker: Puroast doesn't claim it's the best coffee in the world. It claims to be a coffee that is processed in a way to reduce acid effects from drinking it. To my senses, it does just that. (They claim to have published research that supports it, so trace their links for science.) Usually I don't drink coffee in the evenings because the acid feel just churns through the night. Not so with the Puroast. It performed for me just as advertised.<br /><br />So: the flavor's not exceptional, but that's what sugar, flavored creamers, or other add-ins can help address. The value's not great, but it is cheaper than a trip to Starbucks. And if you can't have the full-acid of a normal coffee, this one is worth a try."

It didn't have that paint-thinner flavor that cheap coffees have (I'm looking at you Folgers). But it also didn't have the depth and richness that I associate with high-quality French roasts. Not a lot of body in this coffee (body is that heaviness on the tongue). Most French roasts have much more body, but some people might prefer this coffee because it has less. Taste-wise, this coffee is also fairly low in acidity (which you would expect from the brand), but low acidity is characteristic of most French roasts. I don't know how much easier this will be on the sensitive stomach.<br /><br />My guess is that if your stomach has serious acid problems, then this coffee will still be too much for it. If you just get a little sour stomach, you might be able to handle some other brands, and trial and error should lead you to the right one. I hesitate to recommend this coffee because of the price. You're paying a premium price for a middling flavor. I think most people  with acid sensitivity should be able to find a better coffee they can stomach for the same price or a much cheaper option with the same flavor.

However, I would characterize the taste--and I'm trying to be diplomatic here--as reminiscent of a slightly old coffee foil pack found in a three star hotel.  I'll admit to being somewhat of a Starbucks addict, and I don't think the Puroast will convince me to change.  However, I think it would be a good option to have on hand for times when my stomach is acting up but I still need my morning caffeine fix, and if my stomach forced me to where I had to choose between the Puroast low acid coffee or no coffee at all, I'd gratefully drink the Puroast."

Now I can have my coffee and ditch the antacids when I drink Puroast. So I figure this is a win-win situation. I'm saving money on antacids and enjoying my coffee at the same time.<br /><br />Having noted that, I know people can be very selective when choosing a favorite coffee. So this may not be to your taste but it certainly hit the spot with me. Give it a try and - if you have time -  give a shout out about whether you like it or not.<br /><br />I also have to confess that I'll probably have some weak moments and drink regular coffee when I don't have the Puroast close at hand. But I'm hoping I'll cut down on my antacid use by at least half or more. I know I'd be able to give up those antacids completely if I drank only decaf but then I'd be walking around in a sleepy state much of the time. Compromises, compromises."

With Data.","Puroast Low Acid Coffee<br />If all you want is low acid, try other beverages. With Data.<br />To start with I do experience occasional heartburn, reflux, etc, so this was a very exciting taste test. I brewed a pot of fairly well renowned regular coffee, and a pot of Puroast. I poured both into identical cups, no milk or sugar to start with. The regular coffee had a deep brown color, while the Puroast had a black brown color. I tested the pH of both, the regular was about 5-5.5 while the Puroast was indeed 7.0 or neutral as claimed. First taste was of the Puroast as I did not want to be prejudiced by the regular taste. Good grief... It was wet, it was warm, very flat taste with no finish, hardly what I would call even an average cup of coffee. The best comparison is that to a day old coffee that has been left to evaporate and oxidize. Perhaps burned charcoal aroma with hints of bitter chocolate and caramel? The standard coffee by comparison had a rich coffee aroma, and the taste was wonderfully balanced coffee bean with tinge of vanilla, and a pleasant finish with a slight kick (the balance finish kick is unfortunately from the acid).<br /><br />I now added some whole milk, and as expected the regular coffee mellowed out a bit, but all of the wonderful flavor still came across. Incredibly when I added milk to the Puroast, it turned a poor tasting cup into an awful tasting cup. The flavor now became that of  mostly spoiled milk! This was such a strange sensation that I had three more people confirm the sour milk phenomenon. To top things of, the color had now become that of black brown mud.<br /><br />So all in all, this was a bad experience. If you have a need to drink a low acid coffee do this. Get yourself your favorite cup of coffee and a bottle of antacid instead."

But because this was a low acid coffee, I wasn't as concerned. I don't suffer from heartburn, acid reflux or mild stomach irritation, but I enjoy decaf coffee the majority of the time. This coffee looked fine, but it didn't smell good. To me, the smell of the coffee brewing is almost as good as drinking it. There just wasn't much of an aroma while brewing or after pouring in the cup. I added cream and the taste was ok. The aftertaste stayed with me long after drinking the coffee. I'll stick with decaf."

Keep that in mind if you also drink your coffee strong: the 3 ounce packets are small.<br /><br />I am a Folgers fan.  It has a full-bodied flavor that is rich and satisfying to me.  So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it."

Admittedly, I am not a big French Roast fan as it tends to taste bitter to me and acidic.  This one may be better than other French Roast because while I thought it tasted weak and bitter it presumably is lower acid.

I like it the best out of major brands, either from the local franchise (cream and sugar) or made at home (black).  Dunkin Donuts' coffee is not for everyone, as it has a heavily roasted taste.  At work, we purchase Starbucks Sumatra from the local coffee delivery distributor (it's actually cheaper than DD or other brands!).  Starbucks House Blend used to be what we bought, but everyone in the office (myself included) felt it was one of the most acidic coffees to drink.  Their Sumatra is stronger but less acidic.  I'm no coffee expert, but the last couple years has definitely opened my eyes to the nuances of coffee flavor.  With that experience, I was interested to try this product.<br /><br />The flavor, off the bat, is certainly less acidic.  I drank it black, as I don't typically add anything to my coffee.  It has a fuller coffee taste than many decafs I've tried, but there is a bit of a dull taste to it.  I made it at home, and have a very clean coffee maker, but it was just a little off.  I prefer it to Dunkin decaf, but not by much.  If you require a non-decaf coffee with low acid, this is a fine choice.  It may improve with sugar or creamer too.  There may be better choices out there for this type of product, or coffees which are full flavor but less acidic.  I am not extremely sensitive to the acid content in coffee, but if you are, this should be a good choice for you."

It has a burnt flavor, even for a French roast and extremely bitter aftertaste.  The aroma was not particularly inviting either.<br /><br />I wish I still had my PH meter because I would have loved to test the acidity of this coffee vs. regular coffee.  Based on the bitter aftertaste and how it reacted on my stomach, I'd guess it is anything but low acid but I have no scientific means to validate my subjective opinion.

I love the taste with a bit of cream and some sweetener. I love it and I drink a lot of it. I've tasted everything from high dollar gourmet blends to cheap supermarket standards just to see which I prefer the most. I'm sometimes as finicky about my coffee as a wine connoisseur is about a robust pinot noir.<br /><br />That's why, when I brewed a pot of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and tested it, I had to get a second opinion. I hated it. It was horrible on every level. The scent of the grounds as I was preparing the pot was my first clue: not only did they not smell like any coffee I've ever smelled, but the scent was almost a burned rubber odor that, when brewing, permeated the house like day old stink.<br /><br />And then there was the taste.<br /><br />I can't speak to whether or not it does what it's purported to do - ease the sensitive stomachs of those for whom normal coffee is too acidic (which occasionally includes me, especially when I drink a cup at night). I can't speak on that because there was no way, after four or five mouthfuls, I was going to force myself to drink any more to find out. Call me crazy, but I sort of expected the coffee, low acid French Roast or not, to taste like coffee. Not like soaked sweat socks poured over radial tires. It may very well be low acid, but the aftertaste alone makes heartburn preferable.<br /><br />But I know that I'm finicky about coffee, so before I became too hasty in my rush to judgement, I secured a second opinion from my father. My father who loves coffee even more than I, but unlike myself, has never met a cup he couldn't drink, and thinks that drinking the two day old swill at the bottom of a scorched pot is better than wasting it to brew fresh. He drinks it black, likes it strong, and has been known to tolerate even my aunt's coffee...and that, for anyone who's tried it, is saying something.<br /><br />So when he poured himself a cup of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and settled in his chair, I watched him for his reaction, expecting him to razz me for my persnickety tastes. He drank half a cup, got up, and poured the rest of the cup and the whole of the remaining pot down the drain.<br /><br />That pretty much says it all."

The first to go was any kind of instant coffee. How anyone could drink that swill is beyond me. Next to go was any kind of additive, such as cream or sugar. The next to go was any kind of ground coffee in a can. Some is marginally OK, but compared to whole-bean coffee, it just doesn't cut it. No, whole-bean coffee without any additives and ground on the spot is the only coffee I'll drink, short of some kind of emergency.<br /><br />When It comes to whole-bean coffees, there's quite an amazing variety. I found Trader Joe's to have an excellent selection from all over the world, and the cost (on a per pound basis) was typically about 50% that of what you might expect to pay in the local super market. I particularly liked their Columbian Supremo. The problem is, the local Trader Joe""s is a long way off and I sometimes run out between visits. Well, I've then picked up some large bags of beans, one of which was Starbucks French Roast, at my local Costco store and it was quite excellent. Starbucks is first rate, but tends to be somewhat pricey, even when purchased at Costco.<br /><br />Well, one day I discovered the Kirkland Signature House Blend bags of whole-bean coffee at Costco. In my opinion, Kirkland Signature products have always been of the highest quality but at a substantially reduced price. For example, this Kirkland coffee is almost half the cost (on a per pound basis) of Starbucks French Roast. But, right on the front of the Kirkland package it says ""Roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co."" Hmmmm. I just had to try this one. Well, it's excellent. It's a little less robust than my Starbucks French Roast, but I prefer it that way. I'd say it's first rate coffee at a bargain basement price. Buying whole-bean coffee at the local supermarket is now out of the question.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed. The aroma was so promising and the coffee just wasn't up to it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

I was impressed by the quality of the spices at Hediard, Fauchon, etc...until recently.<br /><br />Many of those same chefs use either a large amount of, or exclusively, white pepper in their cooking, which was very surprising, as I had tried many sources, usually finding a fetid/fecal aroma in the background (sometimes the foreground!) of much of the product that I had purchased.  I commented on this to the previous head of Spice Hunter, who said that the problem is in production.  The least expensive method is the soak the peppercorns in ponds to remove the outer covering; the ponds become stagnant and the stagnant (read: fetid) aroma becomes part of the peppercorns.  The more expensive method is to soak the peppercorns in running water, which overcomes that problem.<br /><br />There is no comment about the production of this product, but I would be amazed if it were not the latter.  The aroma is so very exciting, with floral and spicy tones, and not a hint in the least of the off-putting aromas of other sources, even such well-known sources as Penzeys.

If I can find these in a b&m store, I'll update, but won't order online again.

The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.<br /><br />I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all, most ingredients were grown in US and Canada. Only three ingredients are sourced from China (rice malt, sesame seeds, and sea salt).  This is important because chemical contamination of China's natural resources is so serious that I won't want to eat a lot of food products grown there without endorsement from very reliable inspection agencies. The company seems to have done a lot of work to make sure the manufacturing process would be safe from microbiological hazard as well.  They also use two 3rd party international inspection agencies.  That being said, I've learned from multiple sources that Chinese factories are known for staging for health inspections. So I cannot just rely on the company's own words.  However, what makes me more convinced is that Whole Foods is one of their buyers.  I think this is an important endorsement for the product.  It makes me feel a lot more comfortable about making the purchase myself.  With the overall food safety concerns removed, I will give this product 4.5 stars.<br /><br />A good reference is Mrs. May's website FAQ on general production.

First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.

She just guarded it for a long while before she ultimately decided to eat it.<br /><br />The one thing that I am docking a star for on this product is that it doesn't last nearly as long as a real pig's ear.

My vet kept asking if I gave him anything different, and this treat was the only thing I gave him.  I gave this treat to my dog, because he LOVES to chew, and I guess I really lost my mind by not reading the ingredients before giving this to him.  I did believe the package when it said, ""easily digestible,"" but I didn't read the other ingredients closely enough.<br /><br />I told my family member, who I gave the bag from Amazon, not to feed his dog this product until I hear if this has happened to others.

(We typically cook 4 pork chops at a time, that weigh a bit under 2 pounds, and all of the chops were well coated.)  Pork often dries out when you cook it, and the S&B actually helped keep them moist and juicy.  With regards to flavor, it tasted almost exactly as I remembered, which was a pleasant surprise.  Savory, but not too spicy or too salty.  My wife and two of my children also enjoyed the pork chops and flavor.  My third child, a 6-year old, didn't really like it, but since he doesn't like how much of anything tastes lately, I wouldn't count his ""no"" very highly.<br /><br />I recommend S&B as a nice way to season your pork or to take a trip down memory lane.  :-)"

It's somewhat easier and less messy then coating the meat in the traditional manner and frying it in a pan. Over the years I have played with this Shake n'Bake by adding a little oil to the tray when putting it in the oven, just to improve the flavor and make the meat have a little more flavor and the coating to have a flavor more like pan-fried without too much oil.

My husband's first words were: ""Oh, this is good!"" And then, the more he ate, the more he thought he ""tasted vegetables."" By the time he finished, he said, ""It was okay."" My first (and lasting) impression was that I tasted, along with the pork chop, a hint of thyme and paprika and not much else.<br /><br />Shake'N Bake adds 40 calories per chop, but my recipe would have added more than that (egg dip plus breadcrumbs).

From that perspective, I really like this product!

Well, the concept is good, but the flavor just isn't quite there.<br />I do like this cooking method for pork. I grew up in house where pork had to be cooked to death because ""you could get trichinosis."" Well now you don't have to cook pork forever anymore.<br />Anyway, the amount of S&B powder in the packet was not enough to cover 6 thin pork chops. I took two 4-inch diameter, 1-inch thick boneless chops and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thick. Then I cut those in half. The S&B barely covered those four pieces. I cooked it according to directions and then checked them with a meat thermometer. One had to go back in for a few minutes.<br />My results looked very little like the picture on the package. I'm thinking the ""serving suggestion"" photo was one chop with an entire packet of S&B packed on to it and fluffed up for the photo. The powder itself is that color, it doesn't develop it in the oven.<br />We had to liberally douse the meat with ketchup or Japanese tonkatsu sauce. You really do need to serve something with it that has some flavor.<br />SOOO, I won't ever buy it. But I might try making something similar with panko crumbs and some seasonings using their cooking method."

While I found the cooking time accurate, there was a flavor disappointment.  The chops came out very juicy, which was great.  I guess my biggest gripe is that the flavoring seemed so subtle because there wasn't enough on each chop.  I think the package amount should either increase, or the number of pork chops should be reduced to about four per package.  It seemed to me that the flavor was good when I scraped it together, but it definitely was too thin on each piece when the directions were followed.

Trouble is, the breading doesn't always stay put. By the time the chop goes into the oven, those crumbs are everywhere but on the meat. Shake N Bake solved that problem with its innovative shake before baking process, although you could use any breading as long as you shake rather than roll or dip the chops into the crumbs. But these are the folks who apparently invented the process, so one really should refrain from shaking and baking when using other brands of breading. Since a pork chop is pretty tasty with this particular mix, I recommend it. It made my chops nice and crispy, the way I like 'em."

Shake 'N' Bake is one of those ""easy dinners"" that reminds me of my childhood, with three brothers and a working single mother meant that our family dinners were quick-and-dirty.  TV dinners with Salisbury steak.  Cardboard pizzas heated up in the oven.  And a quick round of Shake 'N' Bake.  Of these, Shake 'N' Bake was always a hit because as kids we liked shaking the bag. And then voila! Fried chicken or pork cutlet!<br /><br />The nostalgia factor was fun when I made this, putting the pork in a bag and giving it some wild shakes.  The food cooked up decently, and there is nothing really wrong with Shake 'N' Bake.  Ultimately though, there is no real need for it either.  Anyone with a decent kitchen can whip together some flower, bread crumbs, and spices for a home-cooked Shake 'N' Bake anytime they want.<br /><br />Shake 'N' Bake just saves you a little time, by having everything proportioned out and in a bag, ready to go.  If you are like my mother was, with three kids and a job, I can imagine being thankful for easy convenience.  But as with most things relying on the nostalgia factor, one trip down memory lane was enough for me."
23425,B004R8J8E0,A20CQ20J30DJZT,Warren Holzem,0,1,5,1312848000,Pretty Good,"Pork chops can be intimidating. Your classic chop is a very lean piece of meat that can dry-out very quickly, especially if you're concerned about ensuring that the meat is well done because, after all, it's pork.<br /><br />There are a couple ways around this problem. One is to substitute a less lean cut of pork. The less lean pork is far less expensive, and has more flavor on it's own, but it's also fairly fatty. Another way is to plan ahead and soak your chops in a seasoned brine over night. A third way is to bread your chops -- and that's where Shake 'n Bake comes in.<br /><br />Now, first off, I advise strongly not to use this product with shoulder steaks or blade steaks. Use rib chops. The Shake 'N Bake mix includes fat (to keep the breading from sticking to the pan), so it works best with very lean pork. Second, do not oil or grease your pan.<br /><br />Do you need to shake in a bag? Well, you could just dredge, but when you shake in a bag, you get all the sides coated, not just the big sides.<br /><br />I was able to coat four rib chops, and had some coating left. Resist the urge to sprinkle it on the already breaded chops. It won't bake properly if you do that. If you disregarded my advice and bought pork blade steaks instead of chops, you're probably not going to have enough breading for more than three, as the blade steaks generally have more surface area than a rib chop does.<br /><br />As for flavor, this is a very traditional flavor, much as I remembered from my youth. It's quite obvious that we're talking about a cornmeal-based breading, with mild flavors such as onion and celery powder, and only a hint of pepper. If you like a little more bite, you can add a couple extra shakes of black pepper to the mix.<br /><br />If you want to make breaded pork chops from scratch, you certainly can. Get some cornmeal, and some seasonings. Don't forget to grease your pan if you do it yourself. But you know what? Buying cornmeal and spices in bulk isn't less expensive if you're not going to use them up before they loose their freshness. Shake 'N Bake comes sealed in one-meal sized packages, and even if you want to adjust the seasoning, it starts out from a nice baseline.<br /><br />Personally, I like my pork chops grilled. Broiled is another good way. But like I said earlier, pork is very lean, and it's easy to ruin it. So if you're looking to get more lean pork into your diet, the easy way is to go with breaded pork chops, and Shake 'N Bake is the easiest way to do that.<br /><br />But remember: Get rib chops. Do NOT substitute pork blade steaks for breaded pork chops. That's the fast track to a meal that only gets 1 or 2 stars."

I personally really like the breading and flavor, and it seals in the juice of the pork chop. It is also helpful for finicky eaters as it gives the perception of fried food when it really isn't.<br /><br />Its very easy to use, and quite affordable too. I would recommend this for those who want to make a meal in a hurry, or don't have the time to make a sauce or breaded coating for the meat themselves."

That's why, in this review of Shake and Bake Original Pork, I will be calling on my Aunt Agatha to do a special review for all of you.<br /><br />By Interpretive Dance.<br /><br />Agatha is getting on now, but in her day she hoped to be a prima ballerina (even though she only made it to centesimo ballerina). She studied under the expatriate star, Tumbelova, and her husband, Serge Trouserin, but to no great effect. But Agatha could never resist the lure of the tu-tu, and that's why we have her here today. And here she comes!<br /><br />Moving quickly yet forcefully, belying her many years, she is flying around the stage, waving here hands hither and thither. Ah, but now she has stopped, striking poses in just one spot. Now a slow but joyous circling of the stage, a plie here and there, almost in the style of George Balanchine. She's reminding us of the Degas painting, ""The Ballet Class,"" but more in imitation of the teacher than any of the dancers.<br /><br />And so this delightful moment ends, as Aunt Agatha slips off into the wings and onto a chair, breathing heavily. I think we can all divine what Shake and Bake Original Pork is like from such a performance, but for those who missed the significance, I can say that from eating it, it's somewhat bland, but probably just what the target market expects.<br /><br />No doubt, when she gets her breath back, Aunt Agatha will delight us with more interpretations, but for now, we'll let her rest. And you can feel proud of yourself that you were in at the beginning of a new kind of product review, thanks to Amazon."

I was only able to coat 4 thin chops. The chops were done in 15 minutes as promised BUT they were not flavorful at all. Dry coating without much seasoning. I recall having shake n bake in youth and it was much more tasty. I so wanted to love this nostalgic food, but it just was not good at all. ):"
23429,B004R8J8E0,A2AWVROFGSZU4E,My Fake Name,2,6,2,1311897600,I don't HATE it,"Last night I tried this product according to the instructions.  My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center-cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no-bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.<br /><br />One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.<br /><br />I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute -- except for the caramel color -- by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.<br /><br />Why shake?<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip-top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.<br /><br />The package says to buy four to six half-inch-thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of -- just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here -- four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.<br /><br />As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long-term plans to use it again.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).<br /><br />-- Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about ""the photograph I've thoughtfully added.""  Maybe later.<br /><br />-- Update of August 8, 2011: I've now been able to add the photo, so please stop emailing me asking when the heck I'm going to get it posted."

I don't like tons of flavorings to overpower what I'm eating, so if that is what you typically want/need (like tons of salt, garlic, etc.), I'm not sure if this will do it for you.  You could probably add some garlic or spices to the crumb mix if you needed to.  I'm currently on a low-carb diet, so I was not going to put my pork in the mix, but, looking at the label, it really wasn't too bad - so I had some myself!

They cook faster and more evenly.<br />2. It seems that using a bag and shaking wastes a lot of the crumbs.  Instead, put a little bit of water in one bowl, pour some shake-n-bake in a second bowl and leave the package open and accessible.  Then dip the pork pieces in the water, let them drip, then roll them around in the seasoning.  If you need more, pour more in.  Seems to work well.<br /><br />Yum!"

As you may have guessed, you shake the bag, then bake your meat.  It's simple, and it's a low fat alternative to stovetop methods that need oil or butter. But the result is pretty pedestrian.  The coating doesn't crisp very well; it was downright mushy in spots, and the 'spices' in the mix were bland bland bland.<br /><br />Pork is already low fat and bland.  It needs a little bit of fat for flavor.  I don't fry any meat, but I do sautee my pork chops (coated with Panko & my own spices)in a splash of olive oil , which makes them moister, tastier, and crunchier.  To me, the baking just didn't work well.  Maybe if the SnB coating was actually, you know, flavorful, it would have helped.

We had to bake them an extra five minutes, otherwise they came out somewhat soggy, although they still tasted fine. Putting the Shake 'n Bake on the chops is easy. You dump the packet of S&B into a large ziplock bag, lightly wet the chops with water, and then shake each chop in the baggie. Then you put the chops in the oven for 20 minutes (15 was not enough) and don't turn them, leave them on one side. The pork comes out nicely cooked and the breading is tasty.

It is a different form of Basil than we use in the West.<br />In addition to having excellent vitamin and mineral content, Tulsi is an adoptogen.(An adoptogen helps the body adopt to stress--physical or mental.)<br />Organic India, a company who is helping and encouraging farmers in India to produce very excellent , organic products, has a line of Tulsi Teas out.Some are with green tea, some with black, some herbal only.All are wonderful.<br />IMO Chai Masala is the absolute best!<br />I was going through a very stressful downsizing move.And I absolutely CRAVED 3 mugs of this tea every day! I know it helped me sail through that move, even though I'm no longer young.<br /><br />I buy my Tulsi Tea through Amazon because the price is better than at Organic India website, or the health food store.I buy Chai Masala by the case (6 boxes), and this further decreases the price.<br />I strongly recommend this tea nto anyone who'd like a very calming, centering, yet invigorating tea."

I have tried several types and have found that I enjoy Chai Masala and India breakfast the most (I enjoy them separately, but also, 1 bag of India breakfast and 1 of bag of chai masala makes a perfect iced chai.)<br /><br />Black tea will give most anyone an energy boost, but Tulsi tea is unique to me in that it truly does (as the manufacturers claim) leave one feeling both energized and relaxed (perhaps ""centered"" or ""focused"" would be the best word).  Tack onto that the purported health benefits of tulsi, and you've got yourself one fantastic tea!  There are a number of non-tulsi teas I enjoy, but Organic India's Tulsi Tea is the only tea I purchase on a consistent basis and that I always have on hand.

It can't be compared to a professionally made Chai (at least the way I make it), but it totally satisfies my requirement to be able to make it at home anytime I want.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I use Rice Dream instead of real milk, but it still qualifies as something that I can call a decent Chai drink conveniently made at home.

I wish it were a little heavier on the spices. However, of all the instant chai I've tried, this was the best. Which is why I'll be sticking to brewing my own. Because as convenient as this product is, there are major drawbacks:<br /><br />1. It has a strange aftertaste. It coats your tongue a bit (sort of like a fat compound that was cheaply processed). Reminds me of icing made with shortening...a slightly waxy residue remains after each swallow.<br /><br />2. The powder never fully dissolves. A big issue. And we're not talking about a slight residue. You can see the granules floating as you stir and stir and stir. When you get down to the bottom of the mug, several millimeters of powder have accumulated into a brown sludge. The only time I've been successful with getting this to fully dissolve was by bringing it to a boil and sustaining it for several minutes. Even then, there was residue at the bottom of the mug. My coffee and cocoa don't do this, so I'm wondering why Oregon Chai mix does."

The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea bags are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy.

I run an affiliate site, and it's like rolling dice every day to watch the product link change from available to unavailable.<br /><br />So, if you can get your hands on these, and you have a K-Cup brewer at home or at work, I seriously recommend that you try these out. They're a dark roast, which is my only problem with them (darker roasts have less caffeine because it breaks down under the heat of roasting). The fact that they're organic AND fair trade is a huge bonus as well. I'm glad that I don't have to wonder what chemicals are put on the beans and that I know that the farmers were paid fairly for their goods. Sustainability means a lot to me, in the environmental AND human sense.<br /><br />The flavor is heavy and rich but smoother than you would expect. There's just a hint of acid bite in the after-taste that I associate with all of the K-Cup coffees. I drink it black, but it's certainly full-bodied enough to handle even heavy cream. If you take sugar, it will probably bring out the woody flavor that this coffee has. It might even hold up to honey or fructose for the diabetics in the crowd."

It is very smooth and can be easily consumed with minimal creamer.  If you like a strong bold roast, this may not satisfy you.  I use the TImothy's Rainforest Expresso for my morning wakeup (which is the best bold coffee I have found), then I switch to Newman's Own Extra Bold Special Blend later in the day.

The reservoir holds 8 oz. of water to make one cup of coffee. I prefer to put fresh water in a brewing device for every cup of coffee and use bottled water, exclusively, to brew. I like a bold, strong cup of coffee. This Newman blend lacks body and strength. I compared it with using a Solofill resusable K-cup,<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Solofill-Refillable-K-Cup-Keurig-Brewers/dp/B004CXG07S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1334324776&sr=8-2<br /><br />filled with Cafe Oquendo,<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Cafe-Oquendo-Espresso-Coffee-Cubano/dp/B005IBV69K/ref=sr_1_2?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1334324953&sr=1-2<br /><br />and there was no comparison.

I will put the water level on high and fill my travel mug and to me that's plenty strong. I don't go for the french roasts, etc.<br />As for Amazon...brilliant, fast service.

It is still my favorite<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I got to say that I was initially not a huge fan of the idea of k-cups.  I didn't like the ""pod"" coffee and I thought it would just be a passing phase.  When I saw Keurig machines and K-Cups, I immediately snubbed them and marked them off as silly waste of counter space and could not hold a torch to the tried and true drip coffee maker.<br /><br />I could go on for quite some time about why I purchased a Keurig, but you aren't here reading these reviews because you want to know if you want one, you already got one and you are now searching for a strong-solid cup of day to day coffee.  No ""french vanilla"" or ""tiger mint"" or whatever, you just want a cup of black stuff that would make the Marlboro man crack a smile and say ""Damn, that's a fine cup of joe you brewed Mr.""<br /><br />I brew this on a small cup setting (standard cup size), no creme or sugar, and usually have 1 a day on my way to work and 2 on the weekends.  I don't know how well it tastes with sugar/creme but it tastes fantastic without.  If you aren't sure what to expect, think of what a house-blend would taste like if McDonald's coffee and Starbucks coffee beans were mixed together.  There is no aftertaste but it still has a thick bite to it.  Hard to explain.<br /><br />This can be found for a relatively good price, I buy them at roughly .41cents a cup which is fine with me, only spending $200 on coffee a year is a great habit in my opinion.  I was paying more each year on beans by the bag.  I could have spread the beans out more but I never had good luck with brewing small cups on a drip coffeemaker.<br /><br />.41 cents vs. going to a coffeshop and spending well over twice that = win, plus it tastes great =D<br /><br />Definitely add this k-cup to your collection if you are a fan of house blends"

I normally use the aluminum caps to recycle the cups and refill with excellent Viet Namese coffee that I grind as needed. This brand (Trung Ngyuen) can be bought through Amazon. This works well but the cups can only be recycled so many times and you need a source of replacements.

Today, the company remains with the Illy family, with the founder's grandson at the helm. They have 700 employees and sell their brand in over 100 countries. The company uses only Arabica beans, purchased directly from the farmer, rather then the middleman, and produces only one superiour blend.<br /><br />So much for Google info ;o)... Now, here is my personal Illy ""journey"":<br /><br />I am down to only one cup of coffee a day and so I need its taste to be perfect (quality vs quantity). I like my coffee very strong, but dread the bitter aftertaste many strong brands induce (Starbucks would be one). I was introduced to Illy by a co-worker a few years ago, and have not looked back... It provides the strength I crave, with a sweet and smooth aftertaste. Yes, this coffee will grow hair on your chest(figuratively...). The coffee is packed in air free conditions (with nitrogen gas), to help preserve the taste. When you pull of the inner metal seal, you will hear the air hissing its way into the can. The metal cap is a twist off. It is designed to be air tight as well, to prolong the freshness after the can has been opened.<br /><br />Regarding the brewing process: for a decade now I have been using the French press exclusively (I believe it delivers a stronger/sweeter brew). I find the medium grind/medium roast ""blue band"" Illy to be perfect for the purpose. The instructions on the back of the can help you with coffee to water ratio for both the drip machine and the French press. Do not over-agitate the French press after brewing and you will be ok. Alternately, you may purchase whole Illy beans and grind them to your satisfaction (sadly, I am too lazy for that...).<br /><br />Regarding Amazon price and service: Illy is not easy to find in certain parts of the country. Where I live, it requires a trip to the local mall... So, I was happy to find that Amazon offered this product at the same price as my mall, with the cost free, directly to my door, service. The item arrived promptly, with the ""open by"" date fourteen months away. I am a happy customer!<br /><br />I hope the coffee will work for you as well!"

I hear that Illy packs their coffee in nitrogen to help preserve flavor and aroma.

Thinking that I could save some money, I bought this coffee to make myself a fresh cup in the morning.  I was careful to get the right grind size for my french press.  My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.

The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO"">100% Colombia Supremo</a>. For nominally one-third the price of this illy stuff (I've even bagged it on sale at my local Safeway for &lt;$4 for a 12 oz. can!), you get a way tasty cup of fine Columbian coffee. The Don Francisco 100% Colombia Supremo coffee is still the best I've ever tasted -- at any price.<br /><br />'nuff said."

I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind."

23700,B0013NUGDE,A2I18AO597DSDI,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""",1,1,4,1280707200,A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored,"The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of ""there must be something better"".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per ""serving""), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word ""puff"" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed ""all natural"". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them."

I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor."

For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange.

Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying ""chip"" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers.

They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.

I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds."

Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened."

Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying."

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next."

I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

That is a fair description as the lime does heighten the taste buds and enhances the slight heat from the chili.<br /><br />My family really enjoys this flavor and it is among our favorites. We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn. They also can be used with dips although they never seem to last very long in our house."

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just ""different"" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.

These <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RVAWY0"">Popchips Original Potato Chips, 0.8-Ounce Single Serve Bags (Pack of 24)</a> were advertised at a special price and all the flavored ones were sold out, so I decided to try the original flavor. After trying my first bag I have a few comments.<br />1. Great service - I ordered them on 1/27, and they were delivered on 2/3, with no damage to the packaging.<br />2. I like the 24-pack that are individual servings because that helps me regulate portion control.<br />3. As a previous reviewer noted they do taste somewhat like Pringles - whether that's good or bad is up to individual tastes.<br />4. The nutritional information isn't terrible: a serving has 100 calories, 3 grams of fat with no cholesterol or saturated/trans fat, and only 160 mg.sodium; Pringles also contains 160 mg of sodium but has 150 calories and 9 grams of fat, as compared to potato chips with an average of 150 calories, 180 mg. sodium, and 10 grams fat, and pretzels with 110 calories, 450 mg sodium, and 1 gram fat.<br />5. They are kind of dry and bland, but are delicious with salsa - I really liked them with Costco's peach mango salsa! I don't have cottage cheese in the house so I couldn't try that. And I think peanut butter wouldn't be good unless something ""wet"" like sugar-free jam or jelly is also added.<br />I just got them so I'm not sure if I'll reorder another box; I think I'm going to next order Amazon's 6-flavor variety pack (4 Original Potato, 4 BBQ, 4 Salt & Pepper, 4 Sea Salt & Vinegar, 4 Sour Cream & Onion, 4 Cheddar)before deciding.

DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack."

I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.

The bags are hard to open but once you finally open them, of course the bag is less than half full. In my case that was a good thing. The texture is strange and light but I could get used to that. The chili lime ""flavor"" is terrible! Mostly what I taste is lime and salt. I like lime, but not that much. The so called ""chili"" flavor is almost non-existent and not enjoyable.

They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.

They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag."

Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake.

The 1 oz. allows you to stop sooner without wasting good food.  I don't like the extra bags to through away but the 3 oz wastes food and money.  I actually found that at the time I purchased these the 24 x 1 pack here was cheaper than the 12 x 3 pack.  My only hope would be that they introduce a larger resealable for less.  These chips with their simple salt and pepper flavour go with almost everything.  So enjoy.  Bonn Appetite!

This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip, but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack, I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well, but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain, the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky, the salt and pepper is OK, but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line, great chip, great alternative to other chip options.

I also like the plain but only when I have already eaten something spicy. The other varieties aren't bad either. I like these chips because they also help my cravings and I can eat them and have been able to lose weight which I really have needed to do.

I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again.

23973,B0013NUGDE,A3A1OA237FOZFK,#1 Amazon Fan,0,0,5,1296950400,From a picky eater - I love these,"I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.  And at considerably less calories and fat - it's a no brainer."

I would have liked these better (and they would be more healthy) had they been from whole sweet potatoes and then chipped and baked.

It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it."

Harkleroad ""Tiffanys Bookshelf""",0,1,5,1327708800,I loved them!,"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation."

They are about 7 inches across and so unbelievable crispy! We like to eat them more for fun than anything.<br /><br />So when I was offered a chance to try these PopChips, I was excited. The size of each chip is about that of a potato chip. The bag is 100 calories (3 Weight Watchers +Points if you are calculating).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is the sweet, followed by salty of the chip. Second is the crunch that is oh-so satisfying! My 5 year old just loved them while my 8 year old wasn't so hip to the flavor.<br /><br />There is a distinct sweet potato flavor, where the sweet comes in. There are also some other spices that I can't place, but the taste is not spicy hot, is considerably salty. I like them a lot and will continue to buy them to satisfy that late night or mid afternoon need for a crispy, salty snack."

The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar).

The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon.

Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these ""chips"" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's ""good"" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again."

The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.

I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.

They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!"
24254,B001E0T29K,A1RP1THAL7CUMV,Christopher Moynihan,6,6,5,1311120000,Egg Protein Review,"I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product."

However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error.

The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort.

The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of ""Metabolic"" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room."

And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product.

While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other candies (including ""Nutella"") to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene, and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping. Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem. Torani'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth and flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink. It's not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It's relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone."

Martin ""Paulo""",1,2,4,1243641600,Disappointed - it IS sweet,"I ordered the ketchup on the basis of some of the other reviews that gave me the impression that it was UN-sweetened, since I've always thought most U.S. ketchups (and mustard, tartar sauce, baked beans, and coleslaw, for that matter! but don't get me started...) contain way too much sweetener.  When the ketchup arrived, however, I was disappointed to taste - and find that this was, IMHO, just as sweet as any other ketchup on the market.  The key is that, NO, there is no added sugar, no corn syrup - but the product uses agave as a natural sweetener.  So I would recommend this ketchup for people who want to avoid processed sugar and chemical sweeteners - but not for those individuals like me who bemoan the tendency of American food producers to pour sugar and/or corn syrup into anything they can get away with."
24348,B001E5E1NM,A2IPM9EW3CBAY3,Kris Marker,2,5,3,1312934400,Does it rate?,"This is a ketchup I've been really looking forward to trying. Having read the reviews, here and elsewhere, there is pretty good agreement about its merits. Depending on where you look, some people concentrate on its similarity to Heinz, while others talk about how different it is. Here on Amazon, a lot of reviewers feel it's similar to Heinz, some even say it's the same. I expected it to be comparable. It isn't, except that both are good.<br /><br />The difference is in the taste and consistency. The taste of Heinz is much more aggressive than Organicville. You could say it has more zing or kick. I'd imagine its vinegar and sugar content is pretty high. The consistency of Heinz is thicker, and yet smoother, sort of like paint. The Organicville feels lighter, and looks ""grainier"", though it is smooth, of course. It looks more ""natural"", while Heinz has a processed, technicolor look.<br /><br />Neither is better than the other. They're two different animals. Having said that, I'm not sure I like the Organicville, at least on the hamburger I tested it on. I also tried it plain. So while I seemed to be enjoying the new and different taste and texture, and letting myself adjust to the more laid back material, by the last bit of my burger I wasn't dipping it in--and enjoyed that better.<br /><br />Rating the item is actually easier than I thought. One star means ""I hate it"", two stars means ""I don't like it"". I certainly don't hate it, and I wouldn't say I actively dislike it. Five stars means ""I love it"", four stars means ""I like it"". I don't love it and I really can't say I like it, leaving 3 stars or ""It's OK"". I think it's better than ok. But somehow, it doesn't grab me."

Now with kids of my own, I decided to make Shake and Bake for my kids to try too.  The response was as good as I remember that I had - it's crispy and delicious!  Shake and Bake is really easy to make: simply put the Shake and Bake in a plastic bag, wet your chicken a little and toss in and SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE!  Bake it for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees and you'll end up with some crispy ""almost like fried"" chicken.  The flavor isn't too salty, and leans more on the mild side.  If you like it a little spicier, rub on a little tabasco before coating the chicken.<br /><br />This version of Shake and Bake doesn't come with the shaker bag included.  You will need to either 1) have a ziploc bag to put the chicken in, or you can just put the S&B in a pie dish (or other shallow dish) and coat it that way.  We don't like using too many bags, so we just used a large bowl and tossed the chicken around until coated.<br /><br />For people who are having problems with getting soggy bottoms on your chicken, an easy way to keep that from happening is to crumple up the foil and put the chicken on top.  This creates some air pockets under the chicken so that less of it is sitting on the foil.  If you're using chicken wings, you won't even have to crumple the foil because most of the chicken is off the pan.  You can also use a wire rack to make the whole chicken crispy.  Each pack can coat about 6 pieces (we did 2 each of wings, thighs, and drumsticks and had a little left over in the bowl)."

Now I see why after trying it for the first time in years. There are pros & cons. It doesn't taste bad, but it's very bland to me. I just feel like it needs a little something extra. The pro side is that it is extremely fast & easy, just wet the chicken, throw it in a ziploc bag with the packet contents & shake it up. Once in the oven it bakes up nicely with a crispy exterior & keeps the chicken moist. I just wish it had more flavor. As for shipping, you get a clear plastic bag with 12 pouches inside. Someone else mentioned using this to flavor dishes, I could definitely see this as a crispy topping on baked mac & cheese."

No big deal, I always have spare Ziploc bags on hand, and I didn't even use one for this.  I simply poured the seasoning on a plate and dipped the raw chicken onto it, and it covered very well.  I didn't need to coat the chicken in egg or water or anything, the seasoning stuck very well.<br /><br />As for taste, it was very good.  Interestingly, it tasted slightly similar to Old Bay, so I tried it on some Tilapia and that was good, too!"

You can use it on 6 - 8 pieces of chicken, either bone-in or boneless. You simply moisten each piece of chicken, put the coating mix in a bag, put the chicken in the bag (one or two pieces at a time), and shake the bag until the coating mix covers each piece of chicken. Once that is done you put the chicken in an ungreased baking pan, heat the oven to 400 degrees, and cook for either 45 minutes (bone-in) or 20 minutes (boneless). You just stick it in the oven - no need to turn the chicken during cooking - and forget about it until it is done.<br /><br />Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating makes for a quick easy meal to prepare that tastes good. I have to confess that I'm not a particularly good cook and I don't have the patience to fix fancy meals but even I can't mess up when using Shake `N Bake. It is very easy to coat the chicken (although if you have large pieces of chicken you may run out of mixture) and it only takes a matter of seconds to rinse the chicken, coat it, and put it in the oven. You can use it on either bone-in chicken or boneless (for a quicker meal) and while both taste equally good, I prefer to use it on bone-in chicken. It tastes good (sort of like fried chicken) although a bit greasy. The pan can be a bit messy after cooking but it is still an easy cleanup.<br /><br />Shake `N Bake Original Chicken Coating is great when you need to fix a quick easy meal."

I can remember doing chicken breasts and pork chops with my mom many years back.  It is fun and easy, and makes plain old meat more fun.  Now my son is my ""shaker"" and he now loves it like I did.  That being said, let me tell you that it will never look like it does on the front of the package.  The coating is never as thick as in the picture.  What you get is a nice thin coating.<br /><br />This particular style of Shake 'N Bake comes in a pouch so it is missing the plastic bag that you get when you buy it the old fashioned way.  It is not difficult using a Glad or Ziplock brand bag to do your shaking.  This is a nice way to change up your usual grilled or sauteed chicken.  Give it a little shake, bake it in the oven, and enjoy!"

Adding spices before I put the chicken on the pan and during the process allows for a good amount of opportunity to make the chicken to my liking.  With this product, you place a clean, washed piece of chicken in a zip lock bag, and shake it with the ingredients found in this Shake n Bake pouch.  Problem here is it's hard to get a full, even coating around the chicken and just putting it into the oven means you're missing out on some of what you'll get if you are used to a different preparation.  Now, overall this isn't a bad product just a limited one that you can use if you're running low on time in terms of preparation.  Seasoning wise, it's at times hit or miss, you'll get some taste in there but it again depends on how you like to prepare your chicken and with what flavors."

I found some of the coating peeled off when I turned my chicken half way through cooking, so I just patted on some more of the mix to fill in the holes.  The chicken was tasty and moist with very little effort and zero mess.  The mix adds 40 calories and only 1 fat gram per piece of chicken which is probably no more than the traditional egg method.

I did find a great use for the Shake 'N' Bake, though--I coated wedged potatoes with it, then drizzled them with olive oil and baked them for about an hour at 375 degrees. Delicious!

So for me Shake 'n' Bake, which I haven't had since I was at least 10 years old, was the perfect solution.<br /><br />I do however caution that while this worked perfectly well with the full sized chicken breasts, everyone seemed to prefer it more when the chicken was pounded thin.  The chicken came out juicier and less dry and the coating wasn't overwhelmingly salty.<br /><br />As a test group I had three 20somethings (not including myself) and two teens, and made the Shake 'n' Bake with both regular sized breasts and thin cutlets.  Excluding the time it took for me to butterfly the chicken breasts, it took maybe ten minutes total to coat the chicken to our liking and pop it in the oven.  The packaging says to cook the chicken for at least 15 minutes at 425, but I found that cooking it for 20 minutes, and letting it rest for an additional 5 minutes, worked out perfectly.<br /><br />The only complaint received was the saltiness, I didn't season the chicken beforehand (for obvious reasons) and pretty much everyone had assumed I did because the coating was salty.  Point of interest, my sister made a Honey Dijon mustard sauce to dip the chicken into and the coating worked perfectly with that, balancing out some of the sweetness of the honey Dijon."

Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.

I usually love sweet and sour, but this flavor profile tastes more like an artificial pineapple flavor fused with minute-rice. I will not be re-purchasing this item solely based on it's poor execution of flavor.<br />2) Uneven rice texture - The base of this dish is quick-cook rice, and the method that Healthy Choice chose was basically rehydration of cooked rice in a microwave. The result is unevenly cooked rice with either too firm or too soft texture.<br />3) Very sparse serving of veggies/meat - despite the fact that this meal contains veggies/meat, the size of the serving is very sparse. Whether it was to cut production cost or to cut caloric cost, the result is a very meager portion of flavored rice with bits of processed chicken/veggies.<br /><br />All-in-all, this meal has some pros that I was really looking for in no-fridge/to-go meals, but the cons just outweigh them too much.

This really is a nice grape flavor soda pop, even for stevia haters (like me)!","I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated ""better"" offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup.

It was that CROWN and that ROBE that Mr. Newman was wearing that got my eye.<br /><br />""Royal Tea"" from Paul Newman's enterprises!  Why not?  I mean -- who deserved to name his tea ""Royal Tea"" than this superstar whose charitable heart was as good as his acting skills, and as wonderful as his ever-handsome looks?  The maverick in me has always liked the slightly-cocky half-smile Mr. Newman gave so often on the screen.  It was as if he had a touch -- just a touch, mind you -- of anger at our ""esteemed"" leadership, and at authority in general....just as I have?  Probably....<br /><br />Anyway, I bought the tea, and found it's flavour really good.  Tasty tea -- thy name is NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, 100 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS, 7.05-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 6).  It has a light, but very bold flavour.  And a very good flavour, too!<br /><br />I have recently found I must cut down on my favourite sweetener, SPLENDA. (TOO much of anything isn't good -- and too much SPLENDA, at least in my case, was beginning to affect my liver!)  I've partially solved this problem by putting TWO tea-bags in a slightly larger cup, (actually a 22-ounce glass), and this allows me to cut down on my Splenda packets.  It also gives the tea a more robust taste.<br /><br />The message on the back of the box, from Mr. Newman's daughter, Nell, (who appears with him in Royal roobes on the front), is funny, and a priceless view into the mind and heart of the sadly late Mr. Newman.  Who knows, but that he, (and Nell), may very well have had royal ancestors?  He was certainly handsome enough, (and Nell quite beautiful enough), to have this actually be true.  The message is delightful, and I am so glad it has been continued on the box.  (One note to Nell, thoough: a ""perilous"" person is one who is usually a villain(ess).  I take it that you are NOT ""perilous"", but ""imperilled"", (someone who IN danger.)  Please check<br />with the dictionary to be sure I am right on this!<br /><br />I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample the English FORTUM & MASON's ""Royal Blend Tea"".  It is very tasty, too -- but also imported, and thus,<br />very expensive.  NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, is really tasty, less expensive, and truly an AMERICAN tea.  It proves, in a totally American way, that one need not be a king or queen, to enjoy the very best!  If Mr. Newman's ancestors WERE royal, he was continuing in the BEST of royal traditions, by sharing his bounty, (at a very reasonable cost), with those of us who admire all he did.  If his ancestors weren't royal....well, this truly delicious tea proves that ANYONE, no matter what their ancestry --  with enough heart, backing, and expertise -- can produce an exceptional-tasting tea at reasonable cost.<br /><br />""King Paul"" remains in our hearts, and in our happiest memories.  ""Queen Nell"" has our respect, our love, and our admiration.  This black tea -- the black tea that so many of us grew up on -- is our traditional tea, upgraded to a ""royal"" standard by being organic.  Mr. Newman's company also produces organic green tea, which has its own great taste and health benefits.  But for we traditionalists....black tea is it.

More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well."

My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion.

The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.

Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.

He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost ""dust"". The ""dust"" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping.

I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their ""trial size"" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case."

We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods."

The only thing that was better was a completely RAW diet, but with that you never know if the product you have purcahsed is the freshes it can be, and the pet suffers for that. where as the ZIWIPeak stay fresh for at lest 30 days after you open it and longer if you serve from the freezer."

Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!"

I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I ""spiced"" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.

Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he's always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say ""you gonna give me some of that?"" No raw venison for him.

Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.

The texture is the consistency of beef jerky and the pieces are cut pretty small (think holding a small strip between your thumb and index finger about half the size of a fortune cookie paper...  It would be great for training since they are small pieces to feed frequently and more moist than dry kibble.

I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."

I researched these duck/sweet potato treats before finally deciding to buy them. Nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag.<br /><br />Boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon, and misleading information from Smokehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE: Big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages. Just another reason why I don't hesitate to purchase from amazon. They truly have great customer service....rare these days."

Cross your fingers that they pass the muster.<br /><br />Just an update; after two weeks of switching duck and yam treats from a different company, Charlie has become a mad man for these duck and sweet potatoes. The other company is discontinuing their duck and yam, so on a whim and all these great reviews we tried this brand, now if you our down one of the old and one of these on the floor he gobbles down this one and just leaves the old kind. What a great find!  Charlie loves his ""duckie"" which he gets after doing his business outside. He now comes in and sits infront of his treat jar and waits. He eats the duck part first then the sweet potato which shocks me, I can believe he eats a veggie. But he loves them, I can not give a higher review then I am now, if there were a way to give 10 stars these would get 11! Great for dogs with allergies too, no filler just all natural products which makes me feel good about giving them to Charlie!  So worth the price, you only give your doggie 1-3 a day and there are a lot in a pack and it is resealable which keeps them fresh.  And they have the ""rawhide-ish"" duck which is good for their teeth and the sweet potato for fiber. I am kind of lucky that the old brand has stopped making theirs because I found these, and no need to run to Petsmart once a week to buy a new bag these seem to last forever, and are a good size for a treat, bigger than a milk bone and smaller than a greenie. Greenies used to be Charlie's favorite now he turns his nose up at them and wants his ""ducky""  I can't say enough good things about them!<br /><br />I am buying three more bags today just so I have a stock up of them because I never want to run out!"

I looked for a food where the primary ingredients were actually meat or fish. All of Merrick's flavors have meat or fish or poultry (depending on flavor) as the primary ingredient. My cat loves them all! I feed him a half can mixed with water at night and in the morning. His coat is amazing; I noticed a huge improvement in his coat and energy level when I started using this over the cheap-o dry food.

Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.<br /><br />The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain-free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.<br /><br />I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi-finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye-popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s/he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him/her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard-earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.<br /><br />I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star."

Their coats look phenomenal and we haven't had an issue with UT issues since moving to Merrick wet food.

I had just about given up on being able to ever eat chicken noodle soup out of a can until I found Health Valley's variety.  I believe the other two best-tasting no salt added soups are Health Valley's No Salt Added Tomato, and No Salt Added Potato Leek.  I find those varieties to be better than there sodium containing counterparts.  The No Salt Added Vegetable and Black Bean soups are OK.

My dogs did eat this food at first, but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as their previous brand. After reading the ingredients of Beneful, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. I try to avoid corn in all pet foods, and as a main ingredients is just ridiculous. Dogs are meant to eat real meat, they are carnivores. Basically dogs cannot fully digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging when they are not present in the food; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

My cat won't eat any canned cat food or meat, but he loves this cat chow, and he also likes cheese and milk. To vary his diet, I sometimes moisten this dry food with a bit of water and add a pinch of Brewer's Yeast flakes. I also use goat cheese and goat milk for treats.

I know; salt is salt is salt, right?  But this one will change your mind.  The taste and texture are unmistakable.  The salt looks like snow crystals, peach-colored from the minerals in the water from which it's harvested, and the flakes melt like ice shavings on the tongue, leaving a bright, clear taste that's addictive.  As a replacement for salt in recipes, it's expensive; but it's a great substitute for table salt -- not just because it feels like a guilty pleasure, but because I wind up using much less of it to get the equivalent level of salinity -- with far more crunch and character."

When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her, and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter, but the dogs can chew off smooth bits, which they eat. This brand of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them."

It really wasn't too bad, but there are some issues to be aware of if you are going to use it. The directions say add 1/3 cup of very hot water and mix to form a soft dough. No way does this happen. you have to get your hands in there and kind of work it all together and then it is pretty dry and crumbly. Kneading brings it together somewhat. As far as getting it in the pan, just be patient. Flatten it out as best you can and then start working from the center and press outwards. It takes a lot of work, but you can cover a 12 inch pan with it. It will be very thin though. I didn't find the flavor all that objectionable if you have a lot of toppings on it. I think the trick to all this low carb stuff is desperation anyway. Once you are on the diet long enough even cardboard tastes good. :0)"

I'm in the latter phases of the Atkins approach to eating, so I don't have to avoid things like bread and biscuits as religiously as I did before (there's really nothing on Atkins that you can NEVER have), but thanks to this product I can enjoy dough/batter-based goodies much more often than I could if I was just eating the regular, carb-heavy versions of these foods as an occasional treat.<br /><br />Carbquik is admittedly a little pricey, but you get a big box of mix that should last you a while.  I ordered this from Amazon, but it actually shipped from the supplier ""Carbsmart"", which offers a variety of low-carb items for those following a controlled-carbohydrate approach to eating.  By the way, this way of eating has gotten me back to my college weight in record time, and with no trouble maintaining that weight now that I'm there.<br /><br />A final tip about this product: be adventurous and doctor up the recipes on the box as you see fit.  For example, some melted butter and/or a little grated parmesan cheese in the biscuit batter will make for a tastier, more interesting biscuit, and I already told you about the adding-blueberries-to-the-pancake-batter thing.  Chopped strawberries in the pancake batter works great, too!  And I'm still determined to find a way to make decent pizza crust out of this stuff."

The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.  They didn't hold together when I put them in the boiling chicken broth to cook.  I had to pitch the doughy mess and order dinner out.

24837,B000G0EP78,A29313797NGT9L,Eddie Wannabee,4,4,4,1289520000,4.5 Stars For Sure!,"Carbquik sounded too good to be true, but the price in Amazon (and I am surprised at this for isn't Amazon supposed to be the leader in good deals? Or did I just dream that?) is way too high. I have a need to cut down considerably on my carbs consumption and being the bread lover and all things requiring flour, really, I was amazed when I read this flour had 90% less carbs than the leading brand (would that be bisquick?). So I bought a box, no sense in wasting money if it was not going to deliver on the promise, and the very first thing I did was a Banana Nut Bread. It came out very tasty but please note the ingredients besides the flour have a lot to do with the final result. Used EasySweet and brown sugar Splenda instead of regular sugar, walnuts pecans and sliced almonds, cinnamon, heavy cream, etc and did about 3 loaves of what I can easily substitute for any banana bread found in my local supermarket. So that was a score! Next, I tried my luck making oatmeal cookies and these came out pretty tasty and I kept asking myself: ""Have I really created the ultimate, guilt free, less stress oatmeal cookie?"". This is not a perfect mix, by any means, but compared to what is being offered they seem to be one company that cares for that particular segment and equally deserving, in my opinion, of individuals such as myself and their needs and desires. That alone always elicits an emotional response on my part. I have been known to shed a tear or two of joy in my warm kitchen as I see the final products greeting me hello. Did Waffles and they also came out pretty tasty, have to make sure the ingredients and the recipe are bullet proof. I like to mix the flour with lots of cinnamon which according to science is a great glucose equalizer (did anybody said sugar challenged?, perhaps it is time to realize that sugar can take your joy away together with your teeth, if consumed avidly, which is the way I always consume it until now). So I went to netrition.com where I also buy some very good low carb varieties and was happy with the box. So much, in fact, that I just ordered a new one. I envision a day when the wonderful people of this great country will be able to enjoy sweets without the mortifying thought that it is not too healthy for such nice beings. So Carbquik works and if their nutritional information is accurate it is also a much welcome relief into a world where very little attention is paid and given to the needs and desires of people with some kind of restrictions. Now, don't get me wrong, that does not mean we (I count myself in the list) need to settle for subpar, less appealing product just because the situation demands it. No no no, like the song goes: ""you can have your cake and it too"" (bob dylan lay lady lay?) and that is exactly what I am intending on doing these Holidays, known for their tempting treats. Carbquik worked for me and I tip my hat (for a bold head must always be protected) to the makers of this helpful product. Not quite 5 Stars but 4.5 Stars For Sure! Happy Holidays and please make sure to compensate all the eating with a walk, swim or a run!"

Otherwise, it would have been an absolute pleasure to give it a full five stars.<br /><br />I've made waffles, pancakes, and drop biscuits so far and I have to say this stuff is awesome.  The texture is a little strange at first, comes out of package lumpy when it's dry, but mixes up fine.  I also have to use MUCH more water in the recipes than is listed on the box in order to get the right consistency- maybe that is where other reviewers are having taste problems?  Pancakes/waffles cooked up well, thicker than expected so make smaller drops of batter per piece and flatten with spatula as they cook if possible to ensure even heating through the middle and so as to not end up burned.<br /><br />My husband and I have been on Atkins for about 6 months now.  We've splurged on IHOP pancakes a few times in the last few months, and I have to say although the texture is a little different with these, add butter and syrup (even sugar free) this stuff tastes like the real thing.  We can even eat them plain and they taste not too far from normal pancakes.  I suggest adding more water/ half and half in the recipe (for pancakes we added 1 cup half and half, almost 1 cup water to get the consistency we like) because you'll find when you mix it up it's like the batter is a black hole for moisture.  My tastes haven't changed too much and I still by far prefer ""real"" food, but I've found this mix is a completely different ballgame when it comes to ""diabetic/diet"" foods and there's not too big a difference.<br /><br />Also, the fiber in this is AWESOME!

Seriously, they are so good- even my kids like them; they couldn't tell they were low-carb.  They were soft, light, and buttery like the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster.  I wouldn't recommend using the plain ol' water and carbquick biscuit recipe.  Even if you use real Bisquick, those biscuits are NEVER going to be any good.  Anyone who has made biscuits from scratch knows they have to have a lot of fat in them- either butter or shortening- to be edible.  And you have to stop messing with the dough as soon as everything is moist enough to stick together- don't knead it at all or you'll wind up with hocky pucks.  Anyway,  follow the directions, measure accurately and don't cut corners- margarine?? yuck!  The recipe says to use butter, so don't complain if you don't follow directions and you wind up with a mess.<br /><br />I'll be making the pancakes tomorrow- can't wait!!

24850,B000G0EP78,A3RRIP2E45NGRQ,LCW,1,1,5,1325721600,Delicious low carb alternative,"I regularly use low carb bake mix.  I have for years.  Sometimes I use it on its own, sometimes I'll do half real flour half lc bake mix.  I've tried Atkins, Bob's Redmill, and Carbquick.  Carbquick is by far the best tasting mix.  It has a lighter less wheaty taste than flour but it's also much more buttery tasting.  Like some reviews have said, it does have a slightly salty taste.  I just reduce the amount of salt called for by 1/2 to 1/3 and that takes care of it.  Bob's Redmill is good but a lot higher in carbs and Atkins tastes too much like soy and the cooked products taste bland and empty.<br /><br />As far as being healthy, I wouldn't necessarily equate Carbquick to a health food but when you're on a low carb diet and use it in moderation it is perfect for what it's meant to be, a low carb substitute for foods you shouldn't be eating a ton of anyway. Every recipe I've made off the box comes out great.  For the drop biscuits I add about 2 T of heavy cream and subtract that amount of water.  Its great as a light breading for Chicken Parm or fish and of course, the pancakes or waffles are great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and will keep using it as long as they make it.<br /><br />Oh, and like others have said, it's ridiculously overpriced on Amazon.  Get it from Netrition instead."

Bonus, I got a shot of Amazon's price and my local health food store was happy to beat it and they deliver 2 boxes to me every 3 wks. Just like amazon's subscription service. Since this is such a lo carb staple it was worth setting up a cheaper option."

I tried pizza crust (mix+water) and I thought it tasted fine till the aftertaste. I've been eating organic for about a year and maybe its just my taste buds. A lot of processed foods have weird tastes to me now. Anyways, I wanted some more low carb variety in my diet and I thought why not try this. I have to say that I was disappointed. I ended up scraping off the sauce onto some organic low carb bread I have. I will try a pancake recipe since that seems to be popular.<br /><br />-Tried pancakes and they tasted a lot better. I think that, for me, this mix can not be eaten alone. I have to mix with a few other ingredients to get the taste that I like. Also, I used stevia to sweeten the mix and that worked just fine in place of splenda. Bumped up to four stars."

First of all, Carbquik takes about 15 minutes to cook, so the vegetables and cheese have enough time to cook and blend together. And knowing that it has 90 percent less carbohydrates doesn't make me feel guilty when I have a pizza craving. I don't feel bloated and sick like I do after I engorge myself on a fast food pizza. Carbquik is the base of a healthy pizza that makes me feel good after eating it. We have reordered many times and always have several boxes in reserve."

Like it stated on the box you have to cook it gently or it will fall apart. Mine did. But by the time I actually got to eat it I didn't care how it looked. It had been two years since I had made chicken and dumplings. And three months since starting on a seriously low carb diet. I wanted some dumplings. Even though it fell apart it was delicious. The kids ate it and loved it once I could get them to try it. None of them had ever tried chicken and dumplings before. They looked at it like I was offering them slugs for dinner. But hunger won and they tried it. My husband even loved it. We gave it 10 thumbs up. Later we made pancakes. They were also yummy. The only downfall is the price. We cant completely replace flour for the whole family with this product or we would blow our whole grocery budget. So for now we are keeping it just for the low carb eaters. Sadly this means I will have to cook two batches of anything made with flour. One for the dieters and one for the non dieters.
24863,B000G0EP78,A16R2MSVUZ9N1T,Jim H.,0,0,4,1336089600,"Great product, but strange texture","The taste is different than flour for sure, but in a very good way. Just be careful when substituting it in recipes where you're hoping for something sturdy or stiff. When used in pizza crusts, it tends to crumble and you end up with more of a pizza casserole. However, it makes excellent pancakes, and when used in sauces/rousses, it's basically indistinguishable from flour. All in all, the texture takes getting used to but the taste and low-carb formulation are definitely worth it."

It isn't. Go to the isle on your grocery store and you will see that there is about a 5 carb/ 20 calorie difference between this and regular wheat flour. NOT TO MENTION, this is WHITE, REFINED, HIGHLY PROCESSED. Taste delicious, if you are on atkins or Dukans and you eat this, you may experience what I experienced. My experience is what made me turn around and realize the truth about this product:<br />1. INSANE cravings for more carbs. You will want them whether it comes from this product or junk. That is because a carb is a carb and regular store bought/ restaurant style/ vending machines/ cafeteria food/ etc will not use this product. You will seriously slip in your will power. The serving size for CARBquick is ONLY 1/4 a cup. You'd do yourself a favor and just spend the money on a regular slice of bread.<br />2. ACNE golore. I have minimal acne. Wheat makes me break out. Atkins gave me the clearest skin ever. After a week of this product I had tiny zits all over my face! Unacceptable!<br /><br />Considering the expense of this product, it is not worth paying for.

Many body builders use this as a natural alternative to chemical sweeteners like sucralose when trying to cut calories. Another plus, Xylitol is good for you teeth! I use it to make homemade tooth paste and mouthwash that really works. The only downside is that Xylitol can be pricey. Average cost is $7 per pound. I have only tried the Now brand, but I have also heard good things about Ideal brand Xylitol, which also offers a ""brown sugar"" version. Oh yes, and please do read labels. Toxic to animals!

This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups."

Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied, smooth coffee. If you like Creme Brulee and you like coffee, you have to try this.

To me, I don't care about brand necessarily, I just like flavored coffee.  On the top of my list are Gloria Jean's assorted flavors (Hazelnut, French Vanilla, White Chocolate -- I think).  That one also includes a Mudslide flavor, but we thought it had a slight coconut taste we didn't care for.  I like the Kahlua brand Kahlua coffee, but the flavor portion is a little strong. But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor.  It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio.  You can taste it, but still taste the coffee.  And my kitchen smells heavenly!  But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences.  If you typically like this type of flavored coffee, you will love this flavor.  And I definitely recommend Subscribe and Save for K-cups if you have a Keurig.  It's the most economical way to get them.  You get a discount and free shipping."

In short, I am VERY dissapointed with this one! At any setting on the Keurig, this coffee tastes terrible. There is next to no vanilla flavor or notes (and the little there is tastes totally artificial and way off on accuracy for vanilla), and the coffee itself tastes very cheap and low quality. I wouldn't even give away these remaining French Vanilla K-cups, so I just tossed them in the garbage."

Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that."

Nothing wrong with that. But if someone served me this and asked me to identify the flavor, creme brulee wouldn't even make it on the list.

When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.

The decadent aroma of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle imbues your kitchen (or office) as you brew this light roast from Van Houtte. We brewed a couple cups at the office (in a cubicle) and the rich aroma carried through the office air vents, attracting droopy-eyed co-workers in search of chocolate.<br /><br />Delicate for a flavored coffee, this blend made a delicious afternoon treat. And, amazingly, the artificial flavoring doesn't leave a strong chemical aftertaste. The smell of rich chocolate and raspberries lingers after the last sip, giving the impression that a team of chocolatiers just departed. Honestly, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2"">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a> is heady stuff.<br /><br />We tested and enjoyed Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle both on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) and small mug (7.25 oz) settings. According to the Van Houtte website, ""The 8-oz size makes the ideal cup of coffee, but you can vary the cup size if you want to change the coffee's strength (for example, choose a larger cup size to get a less intense cup of coffee).""<br /><br />If you are concerned about freshness, our box of 24K cups came with an expiration date of July 10, 2011, or more than six months from our purchase date.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars."
